There is no good competidor app for this. Even wolfram, because doesnt works offline. Think on engineering students that need to solve 5x5 linear systems or work with vectors, polynomial regressions and interpolations. If you make a fancy hp prime app, I'm absolutely sure that I'll buy it!!!"
1,"January 2, 2018", The calculator actually looks very nice and performs great except for one thing. Enter this in the calculator...6/2(1+2) and you get 1.  The correct answer is 9.  How much more does not follow standards is what bothers me.  Fix this order of operations goof for 5 stars.

And it is my favorite because it is simple yet powerful, and visually polished. For example a lot of calculators miss 'E' symbol that let you to enter numbers in scientific notation. Or one tap switch between fixed number of digits, engineering or scientific representation. Or dedicated button for -1 power. I really hope that new features will not break simplicity and convenience of this calculator."

4,"May 1, 2017", I've been looking for a LSRL calculator(Least Squares Regression Line).  Any chance that someone could make an app for one?!  It would make me oh so happy!!
5,"January 5, 2017","Almost for me It would be nice if one could apply functions (cox, sqrt, ...) to the current value - just like it was on my old TI-30."
5,"March 21, 2017", Making degrees a default mode was a nice move. Decimal to fraction will be nice touch. Please look into it.
4,"March 21, 2017", The design and the  functionality is great. I love this app to do calculations at my college  and i prefer it to my calculator. But why am i seeing in app purchases  permission here?

2,"September 5, 2016"," Do not download this app. I did a calculation using sin45 and it gave the wrong figure, which caused me to get something made, which didn't fit! Worse than utterly useless.  Apparently the default is Radians unlike all other Scientific Calculators I've ever known including the fx series."
5,"November 8, 2017", Everything included in this app made this the best calculator app out there. But missing Permutation and Combination functions! Those are really essential for a scientific calculator. Do you have any plan for this?
