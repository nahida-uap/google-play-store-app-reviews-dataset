start, hope to be improved."

4,"May 27, 2018"," Generally pretty good, and makes a good job of looking like an FX-995.

5,"April 24, 2018"," I like to figure problems in my head just to waste time. This app makes it 
easier to learn. Some people find my hobby boring. I kinda like it. :)"
4,"May 5, 2018"," Good app. The ""LCD"" display looks very realistic. Thanks for answering my 
question, I was confused but you set me straight."
5,"May 18, 2018"," I've been using HIPER Calc, arguably a much better calculator. But this one 
is quite good (faithful and realistic to the device it tried to emulate), I 
think I had to put it to my preferred app list"

and it's cotangent is not zero either. Really? These are pretty basic 
errors that should have been corrected in the early stages of this app's

4,"February 19, 2018", Nice work. need to make screen blink after entering same number in screen e.g. 2*2 must blink when 2nd 2 entered.
5,"March 7, 2018", Love it. Just like my calculators I used at school / college 30 years ago.  Now I always have one. I
5,"February 18, 2018", Awesome. Gives same feeling of scientific calculator used physically. Exactly same.

4,"December 20, 2017", Simple & practical .
5,"October 14, 2017", Excellent app. Just what I was looking for.
3,"September 22, 2017"," Keyboard too busy, No complex numbers."
5,"October 9, 2017", Excellent calculator!!
5,"September 4, 2017", Nice ! Wish there was fx-100 emulation because it has imaginary numbers and ENG number format
5,"September 13, 2017", Excellent calculator
5,"July 19, 2017", Great app. Keep it up
4,"March 31, 2018", Just like the vintage scientific calculators I used.  Please add option to disable haptic feedback and speed up app loading time (takes longer to open compared to other scientific calcs in Play Store).
5,"January 24, 2018", Real CASIO fx-990 & fx-995(with solar panel). Remembering my old days of 1985. The Golden days. A very good calculator. I was student of Army Burn Hall College Atd.
