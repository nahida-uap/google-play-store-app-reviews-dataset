While taking inputs it lags a little, although it calculates & shows results without any lag. But most of the problems occur when switching tasks. As I need to switch between any task like PDF Reader & FSC, often I find the calculator keys to be jumbled up. Doesn't work properly without restarting the app. Probably the glitches are because there are too many features within a small size. You can increase size to 5-7MB, but please remove the glitches. It's my physical calculator replacement now."

Yes there are lots of features but it's nonintuitive, could do with being customizable so useful features to a given user can be put on front screen and the swiping it keeps reminding us about until you disable the warning work. A more obvious means of accessing settings would help or at least a 'don't show again' option on that blasted swipe information thing that is so unhelpfully positioned and irrelevant much of the time."
5,"March 6, 2017"," This app sure has lots of downsides like on the comment section, but its completely free and has almost completed functions unlike other calc app, might hard to use sometimes but worth to use if u love math. 5 stars from me."
1,"December 1, 2016",There was a feature left behind.... The feature wasn't in there and the manual is crappy sorry I don't like it
4,"March 13, 2017"," With so many functions, the interface can seem cluttered and has a steep learning curve . I've found it very useful as a calculus equation solver, but for simpler quick calculations you will probably want to use your stock calculator app."
1,"December 21, 2016", Whenever I clicked to get the awnser for a long equation it would always give me a little box right in the way of my awnser telling me I can swipe for more options and I'd have to wait for it to go away. Every. Time. Also it's quite laggy

For some reason though it defaults to work in degrees. This is easily fixed in the settings but is not how a scientific calculator should work by default. Also it has a lot of functions, but some of them are rather pointless. It has stats functions for instance but no stats mode. It's also easy to slip up and miss the rather small arrow keys when you're in a hurry, which results in the wrong keys being pressed."
