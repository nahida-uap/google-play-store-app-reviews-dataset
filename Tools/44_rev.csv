4,"February 5, 2015",A simple and attractive UI It was the main reason for me downloading this scientific calculator over all the others that adopted a cluttered skeuomorphic aesthetic. One function that would be useful is the ability to view the calculations history.
2,"January 17, 2015",Doesn't give feedback to user. I installed this on my G3 and it looks nice but nothing appears on the top screen when I try to use it. The buttons don't work at all.

Puzzling.  What's worse is the constant ads that show up. Rather unexpected in a calculator app, though I understand that the developer needs some money for his or her work.  I have to admit, though, that it is surprisingly beautiful. Like, SERIOUSLY amazingly beautiful. Again ― unexpected for a scientific calculator app. But it looks so great. Maybe it's the best calculator app ever if you get the premium version."
3,"October 24, 2014","Looks nice, small problems When doing e.g. 2x4= you see 8, but when i press *pi=, i just see pi instead of 8 times pi."

The problem seems to lie in there being no means of having an order or operations (PEMDAS). This calculates the equation as (2+3)*4 when it should be 2+(3*4). No matter what,  each calculation is calculated in a linear fashion,  which throws off amounts it seems.   Until there comes an option to allow the use of parentheses  to determine order of operation,  I feel like I cannot rate this app favorably. Looks nice though!"

1,"April 5, 2014","Astonishing Quite remarkably inaccurate. Sin 30° isn't 0.5 apparently, (1/3)*3 isn't equal to 1. Worth downloading just to see what it gets wrong, except the ads are really annoying."
4,"April 4, 2014",It's beautiful but... ... The first thing I noticed is the lack of history. So I can't re use previous calculations. :(
1,"April 6, 2014","Woah hold on I almost installed, but saw long permissions list. This is a calculator! You don't need my permission, network access, activity information, etc. You only need the screen and processor. People, think before install, this thing is a secret spybot."

The free version displays full screen adverts and isn't really worth using, especially given the number of very good free calculators available (although most are considerably uglier). I can't see a compelling reason to pay for the full version, as reasonably priced as it  is, unless the pretty interface is genuinely important to you."
1,"February 10, 2016","Worst Don't download, too many ads, ads while starting the app, ads while closing the app, ads even while using the app. It is not a calculator app, it is actually ads app. Don't waste your time to download this app. Go for another calculator app, it will worth."
1,"March 16, 2014",Worst Worst calculator app. Looks wise it is good but opens a full screen ad as soon as started. Annoying. Uninstalled immediately after noticing that childish mindset of developer. If that ad was not there then I would used it.
3,"July 16, 2015","Good and nice, but ads are too annoying Understand this is free app, but ads here are more annoying than in vast majority of free apps I tried - it pops up occupying full screen, and usually this happens when you need to calculate smth quickly...

Missing a lot of functionality you'd expect of a legitimate scientific calculator like combinatorics, absolute values and expressing decimals as fractions. Also no ability to use an answer in a subsequent calculation. Probably sacrificed all this functionality for aesthetics. Not to mention the permissions. 0 stars if I could"
4,"April 7, 2014","Great app. Missing some ""key"" functions. I absolutely love how clean this app is and all the different function. The only thing keeping it from five stars is the lack of parentheses. Add those and will definitely be five stars!! (Chemistry and calculus college student)"
3,"May 2, 2014",Looks great but... I know its a free version but does it really need a full screen ad popping up ever few seconds?
4,"March 4, 2015","Nice app but a big flaw imo It has a really nice design, but the only thing that is stopping me from buying the Pro version is that there is no Landscape mode, if you add this I would be a happy user."
1,"May 23, 2014","2 ads within first 7 seconds! Installed and ran,  two fullscreen ads appeared one after the other within the first 7 seconds.  Can't say whether the calculator works as immediately uninstalled!"
2,"October 30, 2014",Fluffy and frilly and and full of ads Don't get me wrong it looks great but full screen takeover ads are not my thing. Its very limited and has no function editing. Get a real scientific calculator like mathsapp or calculator++
