notation. Good job! I wish it was possible for hexadecimal too."
5,"November 14, 2017"," What's not to like about it. No permissions,  developer that's always on top of things.... just awesome"
5,"January 18, 2018"," Great app, as a physics teacher I've recommended this to many of my students."

The free version was updated in December and the Sqrt, Cube Root and Inverse Trig functions work but Pro version is last April and still doesn't work. Not only have the Sqrt & Cube Root functions still not working but the Inverse Trig functions give a 'Maths error' as well. Please fix ASAP This used to be a great ap but not now.  Square and Cube Root functions are not working on Android 7 Nougat.  As good if not better than buying one in a store."
5,"January 14, 2017",App i use all the time So worth the money great app used free version a lot before I bought figured it'd make sense to get rid of ads and buy it
5,"March 12, 2017", Liking it very well so far. Easy to use. All necessary features for scientific calc. Thanks for this app! Question: is there a setting to disable vibrations?
5,"May 10, 2017"," It is a great app similar to Casio  calculator. If support for alphabetic variables  are added,  then, it can become much more greater app.  Also there there should be an option to fix the number of decimal digits. All the best for the devs."

Anyway, an option to always display answers in scientific format (1.2345 x 10^3) or (1.2345 e-4) would be really helpful for my Physics class!! üòÅ"
4,"June 19, 2015",Good It's a good app. The only bug I've found is that converting a number from HEX base containing 'C' an error occurs.
1,"July 22, 2015",Rubbish. Sanders wrong This calculator gives the same answer 1x10^(70) for both 1x10^(20) x 1x10^(50) and 1x10^(20) / 1x10^(50). For the latter the answer should be 1x10^-30. Doesn't seem to be able to handle indices divisions.
1,"August 9, 2014","Totally flawed Great, but completely ruined by over zealous security. Will only open with an internet connection, as such totally unreliable and essentially therefore useless."
5,"November 29, 2014",One of the best! Great scientific calculator. Easy and large conversion menu. Ok decimal to fraction conversion. Missing engineering and scientific notation. Allows for equation modification.

I'd like to see a slightly larger answer screen with font size control, and while there is a 100 ans history range it's slightly clumsy to use. A multiple line scrolling history screen as seen in other apps would put this one over the top. Just ideas though, this app is worth the $4."
5,"May 19, 2013",Excellent Surprisingly easier to use than real scientific calculators. Only wished that the writing inside the buttons themselves would be bigger. Good price as well.
3,"August 10, 2013",OK but.... cannot adjust display format.  Attempted to return the app but it took me longer than the allotted minutes to figure out the app.

It would be good to get a history of both the input expression and the result. Fraction function should be able to convert between fractions and decimals. Why the need for a separate complex mode when could just be in complex mode all the time? Not all functions available in HEX/BIN/OCT mode.  Calculus solver
5,"March 20, 2013","Excellent Calculator Very good calculator. The free version and paid version both are same, however, I like the add free version.  Needless to say, the calculator functions are very impressive and it is worth to have at offered price."
