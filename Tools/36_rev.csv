4,"April 22, 2016",Great HP 15C calculator The best 15C emulator I've have seen and used. Once you have tried RPN for real you're hooked for life!.. ☺ The only thing I miss is the tactile feedback my trusty old (30+ years) HP 15C gives me... ☺
5,"November 28, 2013",Works great. Works just like my old 15C. Obviously it's not as durable and doesn't have the tactile keys. But it's the next best thing to having my real HP 15c back. I owned three of them before moving up to the HP 32S and 48 GX.
4,"September 29, 2014","Nice quality, small display This is a nice implementation of my favorite calculator. The display is a bit small and hard to read. In fact, the entire image is a little more cramped than than it needs to be. The functions are solid so I still gave it four stars."

5,"April 7, 2014","As good as the original I've used the 15c since it came out when I was an electronic tech, then as an engineering student, and for more than 20 years as engineer.  RPN is always the fastest way to get accurate calculations."

And everyone who knows me complains about how good I am at finding things wrong! (The real HP-15C doesn't have ""online manuals."" There's no reason for a simulation of it to have them. Yeah, having to take the tablet out of the keyboard dock so I can use it in ""landscape mode"" might not be convenient but that's the nature of the 15C and that family of HP calculators.) Well, it turns out to not be so stable on my phone ever since Google forced Android 7 on me."

But it's running on much more powerful hardware than HP had and we are now in  version 2.something. So why can't I, for example:   - download the PDFs of the 15C's manuals and access them from inside this app? (Granted, I can switch to a PDF viewer and then switch back to 15C, but that's clunky.)  - call up a display of the stack and the registers?   - do programming in a scrollable window that shows many program steps, and shows them with the key names like LBL A, instead of having to look at one line of e.g.  001-42,21,11 at a time? (that's LBL A)  - save the current program and/or memory contents into the Android device's file system - under a name I choose, so I can store as many different programs and memory content sets as I want - and restore them later? (hint: Use XML for easy read/write access to the data by other programs. Should be able to store both program and memory content together, or separately)  Just some ideas that would take this app to the ""next level"", as we say."

As other reviewers have noted, the key labels are simply too small, this detracts from usability as well as appearance .   I have an HP 15c and the key labels occupy nearly the entire top of the keys.  Unfortunately, the developer has chosen to use the existing system font for labeling the keys and other text. This is a design mistake. The key labels and other text should be bit mapped to ensure fidelity to the original design. I cannot see why this was not done, except for reasons of easy implementation. Not good for an app which is in the higher cost range.   Moreover, in the original HP 15c the 0-9 digits occupy the width of the display screen. In the 15c, the 10 digits are unnecessarily small and occupy less than half the available screen space. Why is this so? Again, a curious design decision.   I have written a rather lengthy review because I think 15c is mostly well done and I like the convenience of having a familiar and very powerful calculator on my Galaxy S2. It just needs some finishing touches to make it an outstanding app."
2,"November 25, 2012", Text too small. You should look at how the 12C has done a good job on this. Why is this taking such a long time to fix?	Text is way too small to be used. I cannot recommend this program until it is fixed.
5,"October 23, 2012","Just like the original My original HP15C is finally showing signs of old age, so it's good to have something to replace it with. It's on my Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy 10.1 tablet. I've tested the high-power functions with no surprises in the results."

The graphics are done ineptly and scale very poorly on larger screens. It looks absolutely atrocious on my tablets at both 1280x800 and 1920x1200. Moreover, key labels use normal characters instead of graphics, so any keys that use special symbols look nothing like the keys on a real 15c.  The esthetics aside, the biggest problem with this app is that it doesn't support any functions that require a key to be held down. This is needed, for instance, to check the available memory, where you would press ""g"" and then hold down the ""mem"" key or, far more importantly, to view the imaginary part of complex numbers by holding down the ""(i)"" key. Instead of allowing you to hold down those keys and displaying the results for as long as the keys are held down (which is what a real 15c does), this app only allows you to tap the keys and displays the results for only a tiny fraction of a second, far too short to make out anything. Essentially, you cannot use complex numbers, which renders this app completely useless."

The X<>Y key is mislabeled, and the clear prefix command (to show the full number of digits calculated) gives a super-quick look, too fast to be of use. Also the menu command (Android) doesn't work, which I suspect should enable me to enable key clicks and save calculator state, in any event I have no access to key clicks or save state.  I'm very glad to see the developer working on a tablet version, but would recommend for update: don't spread this out over the full size of a 10"" tablet screen.
