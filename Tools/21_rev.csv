I tested each one of them according to my requirements but all apps failed except this calculator app N-CALC. Highly recommended.   These are the reasons among all the other reasons why i like this app:  1. It gives u maximum number of digits in the answer no matter how long your calculation is.  2. Maximum number of digits after decimal.  3. No lag or hang.  4. Very smooth and responsive
5,"March 25, 2018"," I like this, but I also like the former N-Calc. I usually use two calcs so where can I get the last version of the former N-Calc app to use both? Version 1.8.2 has some errors"

I'm looking forward to that :)

1,"February 25, 2018", The dev of this app deleted their last iteration and re-uploaded it under a different name. It's riddled with ad's that constantly interupt your calculations. Look elsewhere.
4,"February 24, 2018"," This is really a helpful app eliminating the urgency to carry physical calculator. I'm not able to understand the use of matrix,why not provide a detailed video description.  I'm not able to copy the answer of the calculation, so that i can use it for another calculator by pasting it."
