I think it may the best calculator app right now especially with most others trying to sell paid versions while their apps are getting even dumber than before. They think stupid intuitive actions like putting brackets (in the wrong places), and a fancy look will make their app worth selling. I got so fed up trying out those worthless calculators. Thank god that I stumbled upon this app. It is the most logical calculator just like the Casio calculator with same model number which I am very used to. Good job developers! I would like to buy add free version."
5,"July 12, 2017"," It is the copied version of original calculator.Working with almost all the functions as the hand calculator have.As an engineer ,I need this.This functions all with much ease.Thanks for your team for such a wonderful and hard developments."
1,"November 19, 2016",Too much ads. Really hate it. I think it is fake Casio calculator. Casio calculator is not like this. It is a very good app. The use Casio calculator is nothing but a useless app and wastage of time.
1,"April 4, 2018"," Now what is the most important of the fx-991Ms compared to the other calculators is the M, which indicates is has the engineering symbols available. I don't see any of that option at all anywhere. Also the buttons are way too big. they could be half the size, and than all would fit in the display."
3,"January 5, 2017",Good app Expressions like (4 by 11) whole divided by (3 by 7) takes time to express on it

4,"August 18, 2016",Complex number operations When you are going to provide Complex number operation (x+iy). Include polar to rectangal and viceversa convertion. Coz in Electrical engineering most of the calculations involvs complex numbers.
5,"August 25, 2016", Wow! Awesome calculator. Could you please add the vector operation too.
