When I first downloaded this app several years ago, it operated identical to my calculators. But when it updated the newer version, it changed some of the operations. Before, when you entered a number in memory, it would keep the number until you used the formula [AC,SHIFT,MR] to clear the memory. Now, if you press [AC] it will clear any number in memory.

2,"November 30, 2014","All looks and no substance! Great looking skin. The recent pop-up ads are annoying, but the main issue is that this calculator does not function properly as some others have also noticed. It is useless as a calculator. Like a politician, it is all image and no substance!"
1,"November 28, 2014","The math is the thing I wanted to like this app,  but until it gives 9+6√ó2 == 21, like it is on every other calculator app I have,  it doesn't matter what skin or menu or copy/paste features there are. #orderofoperations"
3,"November 24, 2014",Concept-Yes; Product-Not Full/paid version: Fails at start; works after restart.  Hassles with ads. Loads NEXT TO free copy.  Full/paid reload leaves failures and ads! Looks perfect. Too bad.
2,"November 18, 2014","Looks good but  not worth hassle Looks excellent but: ads make it pretty much unusable,  slow to start up.  Stops working  sometimes.

Most annoyingly & the reason why I am uninstalling it is that it hijacks my browser to take me to the 'buy the full version' every time I open my browser. Some people may be OK  with that.  I'm  not.  I will pay for apps,  but not this way. Adios."
2,"November 29, 2014","Hate FULL SCREEN ADS!?! FULL SCREEN ADS make this app close to worthless. Once you navigate around the FULL SCREEN ADS, you have to recheck the numbers you wanted to enter.  Waste of time!"
3,"November 23, 2014","Nice Application This application has a classic calculator UI which I love it.  However, I think this application has many missing functionalities, such as Kin and Kout.  Unfortunately,  this application on Google nexus 3 displays a blank screen."
1,"November 29, 2014",Horrible I can't even press more than 2 keys without full-screen advertising.  I'm willing to accept advertising for a free app but this is ridiculous. It feels more like a lame piece of adware.  Uninstalled.
2,"December 10, 2014", Ad's ruin the whole experience. If a company can't make an app for free without a bunch of intrusive and annoying Ad's then that company shouldn't make free apps.
5,"November 10, 2014","Nice but 100 times updated but still some functions are not working like "" [(--- , ---)]"" please fix it as soon as possible"
5,"December 17, 2014"," Great calculator, has all of the functions I am ever likely to need. Easy to read interface even on my smaller experia phone"
4,"December 2, 2014",Ads are so annoying Format was familiar to me and easy to use
5,"December 2, 2014","Real calculator I had tried more calc application,but this is real scientific calculator and it has more mathematic functions like that original calculator."
5,"December 5, 2014","Great calculator I haven't  tried all the functions, but this is just like my old IT calculator. How about a manual."
1,"November 24, 2014",Poor thing!!! I need the equation function but there is nothing that could solve the equation questions.
3,"December 18, 2014",Ads and fractions Nice app but the as is not nice to deal with. And it doesn't seem to convert fractions to mix factions
1,"December 9, 2014",Apps for adds So many adds annoying the user. Please do not install.
1,"November 24, 2014", Too many pop up ads everytime you try to use it

I don't use the stock calculator anymore because I love the look of this user interface. Just like using an old school calculator. Still waiting for parenthesis functionality so it will work like a graphing calculator but that's not really necessary for most problems. Great look, strong functionality."
5,"October 30, 2014","Best Better then others bcos contain fraction button,but some of the must press your value then mode plus the white word button that you want"
1,"October 31, 2014",I couldn't even get to the calculator screen It looks like the ads are the only thing that work
3,"October 31, 2014","Fractional Calculation Does Not Work Properly Please fix it. It can't do fractional arithmetic, e.g. one and a half plus three and a half, yields two (wrong). The correct result should be five. Thanx."
5,"October 31, 2014", Why it is now working on my device . it was working before . my device is : HTC ONE X+ . Please do some thing to let it work again. Thanks

3,"October 20, 2014","Nice Calculator It is a app hsas a skin of the Casio fx-260. I still have my old Casio fx-260 from what I see it's exactly the same. The ad's are a bit of a pain,(I just got nailed with 2 political  ads) otherwise it's a fine app..."
