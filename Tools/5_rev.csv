Going by what the free version will do, I may buy the paid version just to support the company that created this mind blowing app. 5 Stars are not given, they are totally earned. Great job Quartic Software. A+  I found this great app thanks to ""Gizmo's  Freeware"" site. I give credit to Gizmo's because without them, I may have never heard of RealCalc Scientific Calculator. It will become my all time favorite app."

It starts instantly, looks realistic, it has lots of built-in functions and features including OCT BIN HEX conversion, but is also straightforward to use for more common operations. Also built-in is a comprehensive help guide, FAQs, release notes for each version and it has a few configuration options including digit display type. There are no ads. If you want an intuitive non-programmable, non-graphing calculator, get this one!"
