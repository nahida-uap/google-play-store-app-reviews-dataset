I recently found CalcTastic Plus. Clearly the winner. As far as I can tell it's got all the functions of Realcalc and more including polar <-> rectangular conversion, a random number generator (which can output integer random numbers as well), and some rudimentary statistics which cleverly uses the registers in the stack as data storage . It also keeps a history not just of numerical results but also of the operations (extremely valuable when in RPN). And it's got a lot more unit conversions than RealCalc. What I'd like to see though is the ""Eng SI "" mode of Hiper Calc where results are displayed in m, k, M, G, T etc. Useful for, among other fields, electronics design. Moreover, an option to switch functions such as square root as primary instead of x-squared would be helpful for some users.  And an ""undo"" function as in RealCalc would be much appreciated as well. Been scouring for a better RPN scientific calculator for Android and I can't find any thus far."
