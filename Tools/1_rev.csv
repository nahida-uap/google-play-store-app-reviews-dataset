numbers to all my previous calculations from the history list. It's easy to 
use and comes with a few themes. No ads. I think the only thing missing is 
a little bit of statistics and regression like finding standard deviation 
and correlation by entering values"
4,"June 2, 2018"," I am an engineer by profession. Use this app a lot. Have replaced my 
physical calculator. Best part is that it doesn't have the annoying adds 
like other calc. It would be more better if there are options like solving 
equations and variable options. Hope these changes in next update."
4,"July 18, 2018"," It looks great and does what it does well. I haven't yet found a way to use 
number bases other than 2, 8, 10, 16 and 60 though, and it seems base 60 
only goes to 3 digits. It also seems that in any base other than 10 it only 
deals with integers."
5,"July 4, 2018"," I always find another sci calc but i end up loving this app. It's very easy 
to use. No need to bring calculator since it has the same feature with my 
sharp calc."
5,"June 8, 2018"," Hi! Can you add Statistics functions? Like the Casio Calculators. Will just 
input numbers and then it will compute for the mean, standard deviation 
etc. Thanks!"
5,"June 7, 2018"," Engineer here. This hasn't completely replaced my hand calculator, but it is the only thing I use for 99% of all use cases. Great app."

sale on eBay because of this app. Well done from an engineer and scientist."
5,"June 25, 2018"," Excellent Calc app for me. Can I suggest adding engeering suffix, and short 
cut keys? ex: 9e-9 = 9n(display) for entering 9e-9 = 9 + (shortcut key) 
anyway his app is already great!!! Thank you for implementing my request 
reminds me of my college calculator. Great App!!!"
4,"July 16, 2018"," Its amazing but there are still some limitations...it can calculate 
factorial of whole number only...not other numbers(real or imaginary)... 
Second limitation is that there are no variables..."
5,"June 21, 2018"," Great for simple calculations as well as the more complicated stuff I need 
to do from time to time. I have stopped needing to keep my Casio calculator 
nearby, though I won't retire it."

they any way to get sounds when the buttons are pressed?"

it had the || function... ""in parallel with"" Eg. R1||R2 = R1 x R2 / R1 + R2"

this is that I can not convert that fraction into a percentage"
