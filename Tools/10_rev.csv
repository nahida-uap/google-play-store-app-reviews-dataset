Check out the mode button and the brief instructions to reveal complex number calculations, number base conversions/calculations, and more. Yes it has adverts, but only as you log out. How else would the developer continue to be able to produce the software? I've used it for several months, and I've never had any issues with the calculator other than the same finger trouble I experience when typing text messages and emails, and that is most likely my own poor coordination. It's a full 5 from me!"

5,"July 19, 2017"," I rate the app at 4.5/5. It's the best calc I've come across. Simple to use, simple in appearance yet with most important mathematical functions/operations. Thumps up to the developing team."
5,"July 14, 2017"," The best one that I was looking for so long. Till now was using some other for a long while, but after using this for once, removed old one.....good work"
5,"June 24, 2017"," Awesome app! Looks and feels great, just like a real Casio. Full of features - but lacks calculus, prime factorization, statistics (sd, reg) and 3D graph. Would be incredible if dev added them! Cheers!"
5,"May 1, 2017", Great calculator worth the download.. recommend highly... the adds are annoying but still good app
1,"March 16, 2018"," I got the right one as I expected. But it shows full screen ads. It is too annoying, so I've uninstalled."

4,"April 7, 2017", It's just like Casio's modern Scientific Calc. But how to draw graphs of equation bcz it doesn't accept '=' sign
5,"August 5, 2017", exactly looks like actual scientific calc..please update regularly so it might be the latest and up to date all the time..

Also the equation mode lacks simple open ""("" and close brackets "")"" and uses something like (*) .. which brackets the entire expression. This makes putting the brackets in right place very frustrating."
5,"February 23, 2017"," This app is very very awesome. I really loved it. It needs no internet connection and network signals. By the way it is very very awesome tool I recomend  everyone if you have no scientific calculator install this app it has all the features required for class 9,10 etc."
4,"February 23, 2017", Great app. Adds are a little annoying and sometimes it doesnt clear properly so you need to use it a little bit slowly to check wverything is correct.
1,"February 21, 2017", This application has many calculation errors. With every release it is a supprise what will be wrong again. Updates only are there for earning money on advertisements.
5,"March 26, 2017", I can't find the Euler's number *e* as like œÄ in the buttons. Please just make the lettering somewhat BOLD. Then it will be awesome üôåüôã ...................And if you want then add night mode additional.
