The learning curve is not that high as everything is user friendly and natural to use, unlike when using different other calculators. Though my only comment is that, it doesn't have all the features of a fully fleged scientific calculator such as solving a linear or quadratic equation (or not that I am aware of). Other than that, I'm really happy with the product and I've been using it quite extensively during my studies. No more hogging around bulky calculators for me!"

This sometimes becomes a problem. Besides all this, the app is very good. Light and easy to use. I definitely recommend it."
5,"November 21, 2017"," I love the app, easier and faster than a real scientific calculator. Now my question is: Do you have some sort of account linked to the app? I will need to reformat my phone and I don't know if I will loose my NCS Plus or not. A profile link would be nice if it doesn't exist yet. Amazing app guys!"

A lot of work has been put into this. However I did not give it a full rating, because of the buttons. I frequently type the wrong things, because the numbers and symbols are not in the centre of the buttons, and the lines that distinguish the buttons are hard to see. I therefore tend to type the adjacent buttons. It reduces the quality experience of the app."
4,"July 16, 2017", Love the functionality and ease of use of the app in addition to its UI but I wish I could get rid of the NCS Plus tab/button/option after purchasing. It's mildly annoying accidentally tapping on it so often. It's better off in the settings menu.
4,"May 11, 2018"," Has all the functionality I expect in a scientific calculator: fully 
editable expressions, history, a ""*10^"" key. The ads are a bit annoying.

1,"July 17, 2017", Annoying ads introduced in last update which totally mess up calculation and experience. Clickable ads do not belong in a calculator!
5,"October 10, 2017", It'a very useful app. Much faster than normal calculators. One thing I would wish to have is arrow key. It was hard to find space between roots or bracket. Thanks anyway for making this wonderful app.

3,"November 21, 2017", This app has been rather slow to open for the last long while. It'll freeze for ~5 seconds on a white screen before loading. It's a bit inconvenient since I usually use this app for quick calculations.
2,"January 13, 2018"," Now seems to take a long time to load up (using a OnePlus 3t). It also frequently runs in the background, but shouldn't have any need to. I've tried reinstalling the app, but no luck in improving the performance."

5,"March 30, 2017"," Better than all the others that claim to be good. It gives fractions as results when you need them, and it even has a really good UI design for such a functional calculator. Definitely sets a new standard for other developers."
5,"November 7, 2016","Awesome little thing! Great design, easy on the eyes and very useful. However, this app really needs degrees, minutes, seconds (DMS)"
4,"March 22, 2017"," Brilliant, but intrusive ads. Would happily pay to remove adverts, would then rate as 5*"
2,"January 21, 2017"," Impossible to use secondary functions. Trying to press the secondary function only registers the primary function of the button, I even tried with a stylus."
5,"March 5, 2017", This is the only app I was finding  When I went to buy the same casio calculator it was $20 and this will cost me only $ 0.5
4,"March 6, 2017"," on my Oneplus 3, there is white space above the calculator display with default screen density. wasted space, the calculator display is too small."
5,"August 4, 2016",Scientific calculator oh thanks god.. i don't need to buy a Casio calculator now..i will download this app aNd i can used it.... anytime...
2,"October 13, 2016","Not bad, I guess... ... I'd give it at least 4 stars if it would support horizontal screen orientation."
5,"September 5, 2016"," Best calc I've used so far, just a few missing features: log base whatever and a set of constants (light speed, g etc)"
2,"February 18, 2017"," Wrong numbers and function would occur no matter what speed you used, except for extreme slow"
5,"October 2, 2016",Loved it.. I don't say anything about this app try it and then become a fan..
4,"April 2, 2017"," Love this calculator, but can you make it so the notification bar and the clear animation change their colors according to the theme applied? Would make a great app even better!"
5,"December 13, 2016","Best calculator for Android It's a good scientific calculator for everyday use, i always recommend this cal. Primary or secondary, most of functions available in this cal, very very suggestive for students, it amazes me it zooming functions, that function is rare for andro-cal"
3,"March 28, 2017"," Not very often i use scientific calculations but whenever i needed to use one, i relied on my computer or my old calculator . This app is handy and made me shift from my old machines.."
1,"May 17, 2017", You do NOT need to know my location by GPS
1,"October 23, 2016",Paid for premium but ads still show up! Why am I still seeing ads?

5,"November 14, 2016","Awesome Needed a quick scientific calculator to help me with sons homework, best I've found thank you for so many options without having to pay"
4,"November 20, 2016",Small change suggestion Hi team. It would be helpful if there was a setting for the answer to be given as a fraction or root where possible first rather than ugly decimals.
5,"March 28, 2017", My new calculator... awesome. But I cant seem to recall my stored answers. how do i do that?
1,"October 19, 2016",No premium Purchased add free version and never upgraded. Poor.
5,"May 22, 2017"," Why do you request new permissions on the latest update, including location and access to photos?"
4,"September 3, 2016",Love it! I really love it and is very useful. But I just hope the answers won't really direct to decimals. Like it can be converted to fractions as well :)
4,"May 22, 2017"," It's very helpful but it will be more helpful to if it had cosh, sinh, tanh and their inverses included. So for now it's a four star :)"
1,"March 14, 2017", Very stupid app it's giving me the wrong answers
5,"April 21, 2017", It is near to real Casio engineering calculator and has good design and good themes . I would like to tell that upgrade the app with integration and differentiation applications.

1,"September 1, 2016","Ad... After updating, there is an advertisement bar, it's really bad..."
5,"November 14, 2016",Very helpful Don't know how many times this has saved me for my maths homework.

1,"July 10, 2016",ADS The latest version contains many ads. You have shown many new features in the change log but didn't mention that this version contains ad. It was the best calculator... but  I am going to uninstall it..
5,"May 26, 2016",Very impressive! This is hands down the best calculator in Play store. The natural display is very well implemented. Love this app.
5,"June 3, 2016","Nice Design and Functionality It handles fraction, it's easy to use and has good material design that's why I consider it better than most of the calculators available here at GP :D"
4,"May 28, 2016",Great But.. The only things that are missing is being able to create  tables. Once that feature is there then this is the best app
5,"May 28, 2016",It is easy to use I dont have to mess up with this app as I do with other fake caculator app
5,"June 16, 2016",Fantastic The only calculator in this store that has the fraction button to calculate equations that have negative index values. Been looking everywhere for that.
5,"June 16, 2016","Nice UI and clean interface, but need some more features Expanded history, fractions with pi using sine or cosine, bug with theme resetting which you are working on"
5,"July 10, 2016", Omg this app has caused me to ditch my calculator
2,"June 21, 2016","Few features Love the UI though. Cannot integrate, differentiate, and solve equations"

1,"June 14, 2016",Doesn't work Can't do math right
4,"May 25, 2016","Good App but When I write 100-25%, it solves 100-0.25 to give 99.75 answer rather it must solve 100-25 to give 75 as answer."
5,"June 1, 2016",Can't tell how glad I am. I've waited for this since the era of Java phones.
4,"May 27, 2016",Nice! Nice ad free scientific calculator with good fraction support

However there's still space for improvement. For instance when I type Sin(60) in Deg mode it gives 0.86 as ans rather than root under 3/2.

4,"May 19, 2016","Nice interface. In effect it doesn't has enough features. It's a very basic calculator, but well done for that purpose."

4,"May 1, 2016"," It's the most easy, stylish calculator, but if it could have a algebra function (CAS)and when it show the answers, instead of decimal, use irrational like π/6 or √2 instead of 0.7, like a second option that shuold be amazing, I like this app too much."
4,"April 27, 2016",It does what it says it does. In my physics type crisis I paid for it And it does what it says. Nice but a little confusing for fact that it doesn't follow the layout of the typical calculator. However I enjoy it.
5,"May 10, 2016",Can't get better than this Hands down best calculator I've used.  It's got every function and works likes a dream.
5,"April 20, 2016",The best calculator on the play store. After trying multiple calculator apps this is by far the most full featured and well designed scientific calculator that I have come across. It is also the only calculator app that I have seen that handled fractions well for some reason.

5,"April 23, 2016","Very nice This is an awesome calculator. Please add some basic statistical functions such as summation (E) over X and X2, SS, variance, and SD - even though you can compute these by making equations, it would be good to get the values faster."
2,"April 27, 2016","Premium won't keep theme settings Bought premium purely for the dark oled theme; however the calculator reverts back to the default theme once every few days. Dev, please fix this. I'm running your app on an Oneplus X."
3,"April 25, 2016","Needs major improvement. When using 100-25%, the result is 99.75. WRONG! The result should be 75! Also, when trying to use a result to continue to solve, you are forces to clear the screen instead of using previous result. Please fix!"
5,"April 23, 2016","Beautiful, intuitive, and powerful. Best scientific calculator app I've tried yet. Still need to find a graphing calculator app up to my standards, so if this app were to add advanced features like statistics and graphing, etc I'd be ecstatic."

1,"March 30, 2016",Absolute rubbish. Gives incorrect answers. Remove this please At first this seems like such a good calculator as it feels great to use. And then you notice you were getting the wrong answers. I cross checked with 3 other calculators and they all got the same answer besides this app. Absolutely shocking. Please remove this
5,"March 18, 2016","A must have for any math calculations A worthy replacement for a portable Casio calculator. Does what it should. The design is a bit cramped, but for the power it delivers, as opposed to Google's calculator, you can't fault it."
1,"March 31, 2016",Constantly crashing The app works great while it's working but every 3 to 4 mins it crashes. It gets quite annoying... I am using a Samsung Note 2. I'm pretty sure it's not the device to blame...
5,"March 25, 2016","Fantastic I came across the dev on reddit, and decided to give it a try.

I don't use it to it's full potential, but for my purposes (lower level math and physics) it's close to perfect. Far better, in my opinion than stock Android calculator, and looks gorgeous. For serious/lab work, I would always use a real calculator, but for studying on the go, this is great. Check it out!"
1,"March 14, 2016","Poorly designed. Having to clear out the answer in order to input a new calculation is incredibly tedious. Pay walling the notification bar is shady, too. Also lacking arrow keys and the ability to expand history/output screen. Awful."
5,"April 6, 2016","Finally some well displayed fractions But I cant see some of the functions on my phone, they appear in blank..."
4,"February 19, 2016","Great Calculator Overall, it's great. The new ""rove"" feature makes it easy easier to move the cursor when using one handed too. I would like a layout with more of the scientific calculator functions in front instead of on long press."
4,"April 3, 2016","Thank you so much I needed this so bad, my calculator keeps getting lost and I needed to find a good alternative on my phone and this is it. I won't get scolded by my tutor anymore thank you."
4,"March 22, 2016","Great calculator , few bugs After awhile of using it, it starts to say ""Math Error"" I cant seem to figure out why ... please fix"
4,"February 25, 2016","Best calculator app I've seen so far This has the right concept to input and display expressions. Very clean. Some features are missing but know they will come in time ie.

Very clean. Some features are missing but know they will come in time ie. Paste numbers from clipboard into inputs, display results as you type and inserting brackets around whole expressions when holding an operation button would be some great additions."
4,"April 5, 2016"," Beautiful concept. It looks OK, but not spectacular. Rove is convenient, but tends to enter numbers and symbols when I try to make small moves."
4,"March 4, 2016","Needs an Antilog function. Also, sometimes you need to tap the AC button twice before it clears the output. Besides this, the app is nearly perfect. Kudos 👍"
5,"March 26, 2016"," Love it. As someone doing mathsand physics, have a calculator is always necessary. Prefer this to my exam calculator shame I can take this in."
4,"April 8, 2016","Really Natural Display I checked aap and really one of the top android aap, one thing i not found was equation, Pls do add equations, sure 5 stars"
5,"March 29, 2016",Works brilliantly Really the most functional scientific calculator I've come across that doesn't feel like hell using it.
4,"March 1, 2016",Awesome Calculator Great UI and functionality. Rove feature is great but lot of general output functions are missing.
5,"April 1, 2016",The calculator you been looking for The does a good job blending in with the material design while not sacrificing feature all on a free app which is real dedication right here.
5,"April 4, 2016",The best scientific calculator for android Exactly what I was looking for. All the function of a scientific calculator on one screen without being a Casio impersonator. I'd love an option to leave results as surds as well.
5,"March 25, 2016","Al fin! He estado esperando un app que sea tan simple y minimalista y al mismo tiempo pueda hacer todo lo que una calculadora, además de la forma ""natural"" de ver las ecuaciones"
5,"February 21, 2016",Best calculator I've seen The AMOLED theme is great but the IAP is too expensive for a calculator.
5,"April 4, 2016",Keep it up The best one ever that I have looking for a long time of being use calculator in smart phone. Wish add some constants that have been use in engineering or chemistry to be more function and convenient to use for science students.
5,"March 4, 2016",Best UI I found it very helpful after my casio scientific calculator its best of best
2,"February 11, 2017", It's hard to start a new calculation when I've finished the first one...Basically it's just irritating    I wouldn't recommend if you plan on doing multi step processes
5,"March 9, 2016","Pretty great. I use this over my ti-84 pretty often. There are some things I'd like to see added, but overall this is the best available."
1,"March 28, 2016",Doesn't fit This app doesn't fit in my screen  Also text on some buttons is not visible  And the secondary feature text is also not visible at all  My phone is Micromax Canvas 2 Plus
5,"March 15, 2016"," I am a science teacher, and recommend this app to all my students. It is the only calculator app able to compete with, and due to the ""favorite"" function may possibly be more efficient than the fx-82."
4,"March 16, 2016",Pretty good What can I say? This is the best calculator app I had installed. Works great!
5,"March 25, 2016","Finally I've been waiting ages for this. Also, it's lightweight. Please don't stop developing this app. Cheers"
4,"April 6, 2016","Excellent calculator I am suddenly interested in physics, at 39, with only a G.E.D, and no experience with any algebraic equations, I have armed myself with a copy of physics for dummies and the app. I must say that the app is on point, easy to use, and free! Thanks!"
5,"April 6, 2016", Few minor bugs are there which need to be taken care of. Otherwise first class. :)
4,"April 2, 2016",Some functions don't work The trig functions (sin cos tan) don't output the correct values.
5,"March 26, 2016","Dr Aminullah Khan It is fantastic. If I find it in my secondary education, I would be an Engr instead of being a Doctor."
5,"April 4, 2016","Awesome in every aspect except the price It is a must have app. It is awesome in every aspect: feature, UI, app permission, etc. It will be perfect if the IAP price is more accessible and it allows theme colors customization."
5,"March 26, 2016",Best app in the store I think this is the only app which is smart and also has the functions of Casio ES-991 which I think only a very apps have
4,"April 3, 2016",Pretty good Its probably better than i can give it credit for because i suck with a calculator in general. If it could train me to know what i was doing with a calculator id rate it 5.
5,"March 22, 2016","The calculator app I've always wanted on my phone Finally the search ends :) thanks, really."
5,"February 19, 2016",Excellent calculator. Numbers could be a tad bigger but overall it functions exactly how I need
5,"February 23, 2016",Almost intuitive I love the way you can reuse entries and use formula. But What is paste code?  Is there a simple get started guide ?
5,"April 5, 2016",Awesome Has almost every calculation except for calculus....if that had been there then it would have been the best thing to happen to a student
1,"April 9, 2016",Seriously I got the wrong answer and you should put in roots.
5,"March 21, 2016","Needs only few permissions. This is the only calculator app I need, without intrusive permissions  like I found in other similar apps. It's easy to use. Thanks!"
5,"May 21, 2016",Love em Best calculator app. All good but there should be a copy and paste option for calculations.
5,"March 20, 2016", nice because when we pultiply   0.0048x0.0048    maximum calculator not give right answer without e error.. but it give right answer . i checked many apps but it is suitable for me..

5,"March 31, 2016",Wow Been looking for this kind of calc app for a while now. Cant believe just found it now. Luckily it was recommended in the front page. Really wanted that fraction function. Nice
3,"March 30, 2016","Need improvement It's ok. Need improvement. After pressing ""="", old calculation should be either kept as history like in TI-84 or deleted when starting new equation."
5,"March 26, 2016",Just like a school calculator I love how e and pi are hold-taps of 2 and 3
3,"March 26, 2016"," buena tu app, pero android no me deja mover tu app a la tarjeta SD ¿porque no se puede ? podrías habilitar esa funcionalidad ?"
5,"March 28, 2016",Just what I was looking for! Made things easy for me since I have not used a calculator like this in 20ish years!
5,"March 30, 2016",Excelente Por fin una calculadora facil de usar con todo lo que se necesita y con una interfaz agradable
