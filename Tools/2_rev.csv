That's it. Pressing +/- should not trigger the start of a new line and a completely new calculation that starts with zero. I might want to reuse the last result.

It looks nice and works nice.

I wish there was a setting to force keeping the number as I enter it. - I wish I could select an equation and edit it. Nothing fancy, just copy paste the equation to the input and allow me to change numbers and rerun it(but if you do it, please make it a textbox editable on tap, do NOT add arrow keys and waste the very nice multiline display!).  All in all thanks a lot for your application!"
3,"October 29, 2014","Nice app,but need arrow keys Nice app...but would have helped if you had provided Arrow keys to position cursor to make the small corrections in the entered data,instead of typing whole lot again just to make small corrections.This would make life easier.Please consider this in next upgrade if possible.Otherwise nice app."

5,"June 3, 2014",Great scicalc!  The best for my use. I have tried many and this is the best scicalc for me.  IMO it has the most logical UI and it's a real joy to use.  The author has thought of almost everything.
5,"May 24, 2014","Excellent Very good app, best graphics (i like very much the idea of showing the equal sign at the result screen - it looks alot more user friendly) and No intrusive permissions! Thanks it's exactly what I was looking for"
5,"January 3, 2014",Very nice. The interface could be improved a bit. Please increase the font size of the shift functions for easier read. The sci  function buttons could be a tad smaller (less height). Well done and thanks for an excellent app!

The programmer features in the paid version look excellent (no more bit counting!) but I just can't memorize calculation state anymore. Not sure how compatible it is with the stack design as I haven't got my head around it yet. Perhaps show the operation that lead to each line?

The user interface is great. I love the history and how it actually tells you what the calculations were for the shown values. I also love how you implemented the statistic calculations into the stack, what a great idea!     ***   The one thing that bothers me about this app is the swap, roll, and drop locations. I feel the swap key should be the second function of the drop key. I also feel that having a roll key isn't very useful without a reverse roll key. (As the hp 15c has.) So a reverse roll second function for the roll key would be great! All this would allow for much easier stack manipulation (not to mention blazing fast calculations!).      ***   Also a dynamic stack would be especially useful for all those statistics functions (just say'n).     ***   I try to only pay for apps from developers who write back, so that I know that they are active. I am very interested in supporting this app."
5,"November 3, 2012","Hands down best calculator on the market! I was in need of a good scientific calculator and of all of them on the market, this one was by far the best. It is a simple task to read the very clean interface and it easily handles all of the advanced calculation I need for my day to day work. I would highly recommend it to anyone!"

5,"September 19, 2012","Fantastic Calculator! Very versatile, accurate calculations and looks great. As good or better than RealCalc or any other free(or paid) scientific calculator.  It even has conversions and statistical calculations too. I haven't found a single hiccup or bug at all. Very nice!"
4,"April 11, 2015","Calculation problem I am unable to calculate a problem in the format x(y+z) It appears that the parentheses is not working. Please fix this problem as it exists in both your free and paid versions. Arrow keys are also necessary and very useful. On the other hand, excellent user interface, it looks very professional."
5,"June 8, 2016","I've tried all of them. This is the best. I've tried all the RPN calculators out there, even the pricy HP Prime app by HP. This one is the best. I do wish it adhered to the material design standard a liiiitle closer, but it's still more material than most. Good news is the pro version has a flatter theme option that looks pretty good."

I thought it was not implemented. Later I found that Paste appears on the menu only if a valid numeric data is present in clipboard. A general rule in user interface is menu items never be hidden, even not be appliable at that moment. Even disabled menu items could be misleading. In this specific case if data can not be parsed as a valid number Paste menu item can inform this. I also found these problems in paste:  - Numbers having hexadecimal digits can not be parsed despite calculator is set in Hex mode.  - White space trimming fails if data have Tab character.  Another problem is the number DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD does not fit to screen (in portrait). Same for A and C. It is better to use monospace fonts in such applications. Similar problem with large numbers on 64 bit decimal mode. It would be nice if settings have a font size options. Overall a nice calculator with lot of funcionalities."
5,"January 18, 2016","Wonderful tool As good an RPN calculator as you'll find in the Play Store for your non-programmable requirements. If like this app, the Plus paid version is even better and at a great price. Highly recommended."
