5,"August 27, 2012","Correction to previous reviews First off, this is a good app. To the previous reviewers, '-4^2=-16' is a mathematically correct statement, as power has precedence over multiplication. You need to do (-4)^2 to get what you want to do. IMO this is the proper way to do things."

5,"March 6, 2012",Amazing calculator app! So useful! I love that it keeps recent calculations and that you can go in and edit them and calculate it again - SO useful!! Just a shame the icon is so ugly because this app sits right on my main homescreen

In Venezuela, for instance, scientific calculators are very expensive. This version works properly on my smart phone. I recommend it in a hundred percent!..."
2,"December 20, 2012","Incorrect use of Manifest The program told me it would not run because my screen was too small.  Geometry constraints are to be written into the android manifest file so that, when I search via Play Store on my device, you app is not displayed.  Otherwise, this is rating inflation."
2,"July 10, 2015"," Lacks an ANS function, eliminating the ability of the calculator to perform recursive functions. How disappointing. Returning the last result is not the same thing."
3,"September 2, 2012",Not good for small resolutions It's almost unusable on small screen phone. In landscape mode the interface doesn't react at all.
