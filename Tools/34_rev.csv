5,"December 14, 2014","Please, make it multi window This is the best calculator for android. But I'd like to use it while taking notes and it is impossible to use it as a floating window. Even on rooted devices, changing dpi and all. The problem is that when reducing its size, the ""buttons"" get all cramped."
5,"June 19, 2014","Good calculator app. Simple & elegant I love using maths app on my phone. I filled out feedback form requesting 2 more functions, polar() and rec() functions. Hope these functions get included in your next app upgrade. Those 2 functions will bring for me alot more usability."
5,"June 26, 2014",Easily the best calculator Title says it :D if you need to do a little more than just simple calculations this is for you. Where can I donate?
5,"September 27, 2015","Best Calc app ever! I have tried a lot of math apps (for my engineering courses) and sincerely this is the most comfortable and complete. Lots of tips and tricks. Lots of hints and plus functions which make this app really friendly and ""funny"". Great job!"
5,"September 7, 2015", Perfect App. Easy to use. Very handy and well organized. Very useful output memory. I love it. I had a class pad 300. I was looking for an App like that but this is way easier and better than my old Classpad.
5,"August 7, 2014","Made with care With many features, good look and being free. One of the few calculators with expression support. Visible last results with easy editing. Gives great comfort compared to the regular calculators!"
5,"September 3, 2015",Excellent App and great appearance if you go into settings and choose iOS button overlays. Very nice intuitive calculator to use with VPAM type method of entry ( Say what you see basically ) - very impressed - can switch to engineering layout within settings also - Thanks for a great app ! Exceptional Calculator !
3,"May 7, 2014","Could be better It's very useful and well done, but it's lacking a basic critical functionality: the ability to copy/paste results and input (in fact it seems to be overriding it)"
4,"May 14, 2014",no graph? it's awesome! but if u add a graphic calculator it'll be excellent
5,"January 31, 2017", Does what it sets out to do. Being able to switch between simple (less clutter) and scientific mode is great
5,"May 3, 2014","Excellent calculator I've tried several calculator apps and this is by far the best and it is free with no ads. Also, it has a list of common physical constants stored in memory and you can add more if you wish."
5,"February 10, 2016",Excellent! Nicely done. Looks good and seems to have all of the features I might need from a calculator without unnecessarily invasive permissions or features.
5,"June 29, 2015","Top of the class I must have tried at least 7 or 8 scientific calculators and this one is by far the best, none of the others even came close. For it to be free and advert free is amazing. Well done."
2,"September 18, 2014",Small Buttons and Bad UI The input is not very accurate if it is not typed with great concentration. Dull UI.
4,"March 1, 2015","Really good but... I can't seem to do equations on this. That's something Id really like to see, but pretty damn amazing for the rest üëç"
5,"October 30, 2014","Downloaded five, use this one Despite the very British name, it's perfect for American engineering students like me who just want a capable, well designed, no frills scientific calculator with minimal ads or privacy permissions. Downloaded five scientific calculators to try them out; this is the one I use."
5,"July 25, 2016",Superb Much more accurate results for inverse trigonometric functions than my real scientific calculator. I would recommend to improve its UI and make the buttons larger.
5,"November 14, 2016","I love it After testing many apps I FINALLY find this one! It has the recall last expression function! The interface is classy, concise, display is large.Good work!"

5,"February 5, 2014",better great calc for everyone engineers to junior high... better than handyCalc because it shows the calculation history as you execute instead of having to scroll through pages.  blows HF calc out of the water of course.  just wish you could change the size of the buttons larger.
