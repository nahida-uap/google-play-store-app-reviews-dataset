It must be possible to enter quite long and complicated expressions,  and possible to go back and edit corrections or variations. Also I want to convert to and calculate in HEX and BIN.

But I intend to buy the PRO version, not so much for the added functions, but mainly to support the project."

I don't need a scientific calculator but I will keep it just in case. The beautiful part is that there are NO ADDS ! It works only on portrait mod but I don't mind.

5,"April 26, 2017", The features and customisation of the free app are great.  I'm not a scientist or a budding mathematician so... this calculator does all I  need.  Thanks.

This is one of the best sci calcs, and to me perhaps the best. Powerful and quite complete functionality (even if fractions, factorization, LCM/MCD are missing at the moment). The display and the keyboard have excellent graphics and realism, to a degree that goes beyond cosmetics and helps with usability and comfort. Some further step towards perfection could be these. The status indicators along the top side of the display need much more contrast. The logo above the keyboard is elegant but steals precious room for hosting two more keys; perhaps it could instead be displayed on the display when the calculator is initialized as a simulated LCD bitmap. Replace some of the more frivolous themes with new ones having high contrast key labels (white on dark to avoid offending the eyes) and slightly bolder characters especially for the second-function labels. Test all the themes in extreme light conditions; also have them tested by elderly people who happen to have lost their glasses... At present the most readable theme seems to be Black Leather."
