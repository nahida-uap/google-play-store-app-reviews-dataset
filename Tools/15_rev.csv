But if a person wish to use it in degree mode it needs to be available. As in CALC mode one can choose any among the DRG by tapping it. But in complex mode it can't be changed even if one wants to. If this option is included to choose D or R or G as per preference it will be more user friendly as in CALC MODE.

But since there's no such ratings available,  I rounded it off to 5 😉. Now the thing that is missing is- not being to able to write fractions & do mathematical operations with them. It is a necessary feature of scientific calculators, at least for me. So I hope you'll introduce this feature soon. Then it'll truly become a 5 star app. Good luck... ☺"
