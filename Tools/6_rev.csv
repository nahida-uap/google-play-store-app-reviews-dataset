5,"March 7, 2016","Good Downloaded to work on log functions, it easily met the purpose. Will rate again after I use more functions. For fellow users: sin(60= is always a error; try sin(60) instead. Remember to close the bracket after you enter the value)."
5,"March 15, 2016","Scientific Calculator is nice! Very user-friendly and easy to use Calculator, I like it. For those that complained of error In finding Sin, Cos,   tan and other, the error is from you; it is because you don't close the open bracket. Just try closing you won't get any error."
4,"June 13, 2016","Just downloaded. Irritating request for a rating after one use. I hope this is not going to be one of those apps that begs for approval everyone you open it. What a pain in the a$$ that will be. Otherwise, a good app."
1,"April 9, 2017", U know an app is going to suck when soon as u install it they want u to rate it. With flashing sailing apps blinking 2 seconds later

1,"April 16, 2016", This rubbish.. I have never such a calculator like this. 2+2= error... Oh my God..this needs to be re checj
3,"July 1, 2018"," The design of the functions is too cumbersome. It takes a longer time to
