It seems to always happen when I press equals or am in the middle of adding a long list of numbers. I'm using Galaxy S4 on Paranoid android 4.42 and Cyanogenmod 11 before that. Also, it would be nice if when I accidentally press a wrong operator,""+,  - "",  it would replace with the correct one when pressed afterwards. Similar to how Windows calculator handles it."
5,"March 13, 2015",Very helpful This is literally the calculator I need. I really like the colors and I love that my problems are saved so I can look back at them.It is also one of the only calculator apps I could find that actually included exponents. I DEFINITELY recommend this app for a tool.
5,"July 7, 2014","Gorgeous too look at, gets the job done One of my pet peeves is when an app does not follow android design guidelines. This does and does so beautifully. Elegant and beautiful to look at, and very functional."
2,"May 11, 2014","Amazing Amazing app, ad free, and very simple. Replaced my default calculator. *FIX* It gives the wrong answer for cos(300) it says -0.5 when it should be 0.5"
5,"May 17, 2014",Awesome app... Thanks to the developer... Just the vibration is not working. Xperia M 4.1.2 stock ROM. ...also please add an option to move cursor left/right it's very useful....
5,"December 7, 2015","Works Perfectly I was sick and this really helped me get through an assignment that was due on Friday, even when I had no real calculator! Cheers to the Developers, I have to say!"
3,"December 31, 2014",Pretty good BUT there is no way to change a number in the middle of a calculation without erasing everything that comes after that number. Should be an easy thing to fix..
5,"November 10, 2014",Icon could use a facelift Everything is great about this calculator. The icon could get updated though. Looks pixelated on my htc one m8 and lg g3.
4,"November 24, 2015",Great UI. App icon doesn't look good on high res displays The UI looks great. But the App icon doesn't look good on phones with 2K display. Please update!!
3,"November 6, 2014",Best one! Only complaint is that you can't use a cursor to go back in the equation before you press =. Would be great if you could get the cursor to show up.
5,"September 4, 2014",Shut up and take my money! It is really a great calculator and is so simple and intuitive. It would be really awesome if it had a calculation history.

5,"March 14, 2015","5 stars (Still) The best calculator I've found so far on Android. I'd love a refreshed design, but a calculator should put function before form, and so I am still happy with the classic Holo design."
4,"July 31, 2017"," Love this, very simple, works great! Unchecking ""make buttons shorter"" isn't working though, the keys stay the same size (small). It's be great if this worked and have larger buttons. (Nexus 6p)"

4,"April 22, 2014","Love the app Best calculator I've used thus  far. However, I would like to have a percentage sign added to give it 5 stars."
4,"April 24, 2014",Nice Just needs a percent function added and it would be perfect. And a way to position the cursor to edit sums.
5,"April 27, 2014", Dev fixed the bug I emailed about so that's a point in favor of this app.
5,"April 21, 2014",Simply Brilliant Very clean and super useful. And very beautiful to use and look at.
5,"June 16, 2013","Neat and elegant It is very simple to use. The interface is very modern, skmple and uncluttered. Very simplistic. Overall, it is a simple everyday use calculator. I can see myself using his calculator over any stock calculator out there. Except if anyone codes a TI calculator then I'll probably use that."
5,"January 20, 2014","Very functional, but... An e^x key or simply a (inverse) shift for log and ln keys would be awesome. Also the white overflow button on the light background really takes away from the polished look."
3,"November 17, 2013","Good looks, not so good functionality. While I truly enjoy the design of the interface, I can't understand why, a calculator is missing such fundamental feature like percentage calculations. I find my self using % far more often than sinus and cosines."
4,"September 11, 2013","No percentage button! This is such a beautiful app that just works. Sadly, they developers missed the percentage button which is such a basic function of a calculator. There goes a 5 star review!"
2,"February 3, 2014","Doesn't work in 4.4.2 Was my favorite calculator, but now cannot open without force closing. KitKat on Samsung Galaxy S3."
4,"January 29, 2014","Clean and beautiful BUT... It's lacking a ""%"" button and digit grouping separators. These additions would make it a perfect 5 stars app."
5,"January 6, 2014",":D Great app! Works way better than the default kitkat calculator app, looks clean, never bugs out, etc. 5/5, would recommend to everybody."
2,"December 12, 2013",Love hate Force closes a lot and it says cos 180 and sin 270 is 1. But easy to use and simple.
4,"September 6, 2013","Just looks nice It's cool that there are simple themes for the calculator, but a calc is a calc. Nothing much fancier than a beautifully designed interface. Functions correctly. Add advanced features for loans and APR, then I will change to a 5 star rating."
5,"November 26, 2013","Best calculator app Scientific functions, basic calculation, awesome theme and design, what more do you want? App works flawlessly, doesnt crash. Has replaced my stock Calculator app. Thanks Dev and keep up the good work!"
5,"June 18, 2013","Simple, but awesome Much better than stock calculator. Love the UI and pretty much everything about the app!"
4,"October 1, 2013",Needs Commas If this app had commas displayed after every 3rd number it would be perfect. Without the commas it makes the numbers difficult to read at times
2,"June 9, 2013",Lack of important features! The design is beautiful and better than the stock app. But where is % and fraction button?????   Note 10.1 user
4,"June 11, 2013",Awesome! It keeps with the Google Card theme. I suggest the ability to swipe away results. Everything is awesome!!
4,"January 16, 2014","Very cool This is definitely the best calculator app out there, please add KitKat transparent status bar and navbar and I'll give it 5 stars, that's all it needs to be perfect"

5,"December 5, 2013","Does its job beautifully. Plain and simple, it is a calculator. It does its job correctly, beautifully, and quickly. It does exactly what it is meant to do, which constitutes a 5-star rating in my book."

5,"May 19, 2013","Great Could use some improvements, but it is pretty good.  The positive /negative button isn't necessary since you can just use the minus sign to make a number negative.  You should look at Xlythe's open source code and include some of those things that are on there."
3,"April 15, 2013","Nice interface but needs improvement You can't edit an equation midway. So if you have entered a very long string and need to correct anything, you have to backspace from the end...  very cumbersome..."
5,"April 9, 2013",Clean and easy to use. This calculator has a very sharp/clean interface that's intuitive and simple to use. It keeps a history of previous calculations that you can scroll through(similar to my TI-89). Overall a great calculator for mobile devices.
3,"April 8, 2013",Great but.. It has a glitch where it shows tge answer for 2 seconds and disappears
5,"April 5, 2013","Awesome calculator app!! Many functions. Simple, intuitive, accurate. You can recall previous numbers and functions. The best calculator app I have found so far."
5,"January 12, 2014", My favotite calculator on my Tab. Would be nice if font is resizable so you can see more results at same time. Also would be nice if it is possible to delete indiviual results instead of all at once.
5,"April 5, 2013",Ideal for Android 4.0+ Users Best interface for a scientific calculator. Only needs more scientific functions as time progresses
5,"May 22, 2013","Nice looking and works well Love the Holo theme, history function, and especially the way the parenthesis button works. Best calculator app I've used."

5,"March 26, 2013",Great calculator Very useful with a nice sleek interface. I like that it shows the history and you can reuse inputs and results.
5,"March 4, 2013","Awesome Calculator, but needs some tweaking Firstly I'd like to say it's an awesome calculator, but reducing vibration intensity would make it nicer and adding a feature to disable () key and x/y key in options would be good aswell, as people like me who needs calculator for simple calculations it'd be nice to get rid of them."
5,"February 19, 2013",Slick design Works great and the smart button input is a great feature!
3,"May 30, 2013","Great looking app App looks and works great. Only three stars though for all the wasted space at the top. I'm sure it comes in handy for someone trying to do ridiculous equations, but for a quick pop open the app to do a quick equation it isn't preferable since it makes the number buttons smaller."
5,"February 18, 2013","Best calculator ever!!! I couldn't be happier with this calculator! It does all of the things I want that other calculators don't, such as remembering previous figures and has a really nice layout. Download this calculator!"
5,"April 4, 2013","Awesome! only problem is that it doesn't have bunches of functions like the built in one does, but it's not like I'm gonna be using those every day, it has all the ones I'm ever gonna use :) also the thing where you can tap the numbers in your last calculation is pretty much the only reason why I'm rating th...Full Reviewonly problem is that it doesn't have bunches of functions like the built in one does, but it's not like I'm gonna be using those every day, it has all the ones I'm ever gonna use :) also the thing where you can tap the numbers in your last calculation is pretty much the only reason why I'm rating this 5 stars for just a calculator haha"

5,"November 7, 2013","Awesome calculator But please rename the calculator to just ""Calculator"" so I can easily find it in my app drawer. Thanks."
5,"July 9, 2013",Why is this not the default calc?! Would like to tap to place cursor on active row & delete single history row
