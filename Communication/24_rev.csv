Hopefully it don't keep changing up."
3,"June 27, 2018"," I can't watch videos. It's awful when I want to tag friends, just I can't 
do it. That sucks."
5,"June 25, 2018", So far I think I like this app coz it's just working well.

3,"March 30, 2018"," Even at good internet speed and clear signal, it still freezes and lags. I cannot see most of what I'm typing regardless of the setting or phone that I use.

I cannot see most of what I'm typing regardless of the setting or phone that I use. Perhaps I just need to buy one of the newest phones out to in order to get functionality from this app that would closely rival the actual messenger app."
1,"April 6, 2018", Used to work decent... Idk if it's a glitch but interface completely changed overnight and now it's just a really crumby way to view fb
3,"April 9, 2018", Menu bar at the bottom gets in the way
2,"March 22, 2018"," It's decent, missing the messaging calling and video calling features. Loose the ads and I'll give more stars ðŸŒŸ"
1,"March 12, 2018", This is NOT the Facebook Messenger Lite app.

3,"June 16, 2017", Having and issue with the messenger portion where my keyboard display covers the text input box and i cant see what i am typing.  Also the phone status bar covers part of the top menu. Besides that it works really good. Btw this is on Droid 4.4 so the version may be an issue.
1,"August 21, 2017"," Shame on you - sure the size comparison is massive against full bloated FB messenger, 9.60MB on my phone, but...!  What about Facebook's own Messenger Lite? The difference isn't quite as large anymore, though you still will, as in my phone it was 19.90 MB  Now it comes to which one does better...

2,"January 14, 2018"," Screen says I'm not logged in but when I press the Login button, it just keeps telling me I'm not logged in. Went to settings and it said Log out. Nothing on the screen except the Not Logged In statement. Cannot use it. Do not like to write poor reviews but it is not usable."
5,"December 31, 2017", Fantastic substitute for the other MSGR apps provided by FB. This has been so far a smooth running easy to configure app. Keeping fingers crossed it stays the best!
4,"September 12, 2017"," 9.57mb---fast refresh newsfeed, annoying ads everytime switch to msg, ads cover amd can't see what I type, low number of reviews, uninstall"
