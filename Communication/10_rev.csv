2,"January 15, 2018", it looked like this had potential but now find it doesn't support group mms messages? It also doesnt have a stand alone android wear app..

3,"February 9, 2018", Don't really know yet
1,"January 16, 2018", Paid for the app and still contains advertisements.
4,"April 12, 2018", Can't get mine to update

3,"December 30, 2017", I think I like it.  Only really dislike the AD banner across top.  Its distracting and annoying.  Full of ADs.  They don't pop up allot but cover every screen and option.  Maybe a deal breaker.  Will test if worth paying or deleting.

Also in privacy page would be nice to change order like by most used alphabet arrangement by first or last name also ascending or desenting in all modes. You developers did a nice job. Only first day of using it. Will gladly give ya all a 5 stars if ya can implement at least one suggestion above preferably bubble color and a few font choices with the ability to change font color. Will rereview after next update or 45 days. Good job!
5,"January 5, 2018", I love it I've had this for awhile now and it's amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è I love the privacy of it makes me feel confident and comfortable that no one can just snoop on my phone and messages are encrypted I like the backgrounds it's a lot of fun to customize ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5,"January 2, 2018"," I love it. To answer the questions regarding the check marks there's a ""Mark as read"" button at the top of the screen and just click on the button to mark your messages as ""read"" or click on the""reply"" button next to the message to reply.. hope that helps ‚ò∫"
5,"February 16, 2018", just trying this out I don't know
5,"January 1, 2018"," I live it but all I wanna know is what do the check marks mean on the message , for example I sent a message and it has two check marks on one message then on another it has one what do that mean??"
3,"January 1, 2018", I am still new in this.
5,"January 12, 2018", Its amazing app no doubts to hackers and.fake accounts users.
5,"January 1, 2018"," Nice, I like it. 1 question....As someone asked before, what do the checkmarks mean?"
5,"January 5, 2018", I just downloaded the app but so far its really easy to use and i love it!!
5,"January 1, 2018", Don't know yet

5,"January 17, 2018", Love it
5,"December 27, 2017", I love the mess out of this app. You would believe the things it can do. Private for creeping with your üòçüíú. To block the fools who keep getting on you nerves. The best one yet
3,"December 26, 2017", An app that brags privacy but wants permission to everything on your device..yea ok so much for private
5,"December 28, 2017", I t it was only just installed

You see it will regularly make me use my code even while im typing or try to access an app for instance today i needed google mapps today and the app lock kept locking me out and i can't understand why once your in and you unlocked the app it would keep locking me out of the app.   TOTALLY FRUSTRATING.  I WAS REALLY WANTING TO DELETE YOUR APP TODAY.. BUT I THOUGHT ID SEE IF THIS WAS A NORMAL PROCEDURE IN THE PROGRAMMING .. So I'd love to hear your thoughts about it   ll.?
5,"December 24, 2017"," I haven't used every feature, but what I have used so far has impressed me."
4,"December 22, 2017", Can I have my messages backed up in my Google account and if yes how?
5,"December 22, 2017", If you blocked somebody can you still see the messages without them getting a delivery report
5,"December 17, 2017"," From what I observed in it so far, is an interesting app that most will like to have it. Nice"
5,"December 15, 2017", I like a lot so far
