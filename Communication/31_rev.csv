1,"June 24, 2018", Loved and used  ICQ for the last 20 years. Now I can't activate on my phone because my number is registered as a virtual or spam number.  ICQ support is useless and wont help!!! So angry that I have to use other chats.
3,"July 1, 2018"," As it's clearly borrowing from Whatsapp it might be time to borrow some of 
the bigger features like encryption and fullscreen video calls. ICQ in it's 
original form was something special in the 90s. This needs more work to be 
it's successor in my opinion. Keep working on it!"
1,"May 30, 2018"," It keeps telling me the phone number I list isn't allowed. I used this for 
many years on my PC and it was so easy to use back then. I can't even get 
into it now. Very disappointed"

My only problem with is that even though you will not open the app it will 
still eat up a lot of data and I just cant figure out why. I hope developer 
will fix this adding a super data saver toggle or option that if enabled 
will not auto download media or autoplay anything to conserve data. Text 
will do and I love the notification because even if its just in the 
background it continues to persist and not get killed. Just fix the data 
hungriness of this app and develop more chatting and social features. Lets 
beat facebook and twitter, etc. GOD bless. üôè"

Users can post any content from ponography through to selfies. Has a great variety of stickers and that is really cool. The moderators really struggle to keep all the spam away. The app itself seems to also updates from its own container rather than through official store updates. Even when I reviewed this I had the latest version and the store says I have an older version.
4,"June 12, 2018"," Used to give this 5-stars, but ICQ v7.2 now says it MUST have a phone 
number to login.... I reinstalled v7.1 and it works fine again. I use a 
tablet, not a phone."
2,"April 5, 2018", Full of scams. In every chat room a lot of videos full of sexual content. It is not recommended for underage to be part of it. Need more control as chat rooms in it have no control on the sexual content that show up.Sad thing.

5,"April 13, 2018"," ICQ is a messenger which is still not bloated with nonsense features. Hope 
it will keep up like this. Beware of the fact that all messages are stored 
in the cloud, just like in fb messenger. The app feels light and reliable."

5,"March 31, 2018", I love this app! I am able to chat with all my friends and use video calling. I can also use face filters for my pictures. It is just like snapchat. I rate it 5 stars because i love how i get to do so many different things on this app... And its FREE!!
4,"April 5, 2018", The first generation of WhatsApp or wechat...I using it since long time ago. Brings back lots of memories.
3,"March 23, 2018", When I first opened the app I denied access to my contacts because I didn't want them listed in the app but they accessed my contacts anyway. If you are going to ignore my response and do what you want then don't ask for permission to access my contacts.
2,"April 14, 2018", There are many scammers and rippers on icq. Try to have some of telegram policies where by you will suspend or delete reported users and groups
