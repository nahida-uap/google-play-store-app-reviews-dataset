slow... sometimes the app is freezing and is impossible to type something. 
The app changes the notification sound by itself, just because it wants so 
and everytime it's a new notification sound. And the most interesting thing 
is that, this problems have only the Android users. My friends who have 
Samsungs, all of them have the described issues. I wouldn't use this app if 
it wouldn't be the only messenger connected to Facebook. I hope that in the 
future the things will change and this app will work properly."

running into problems loading and saving images sent to me from others. The 
odd thing is it only affects photos taken with phone cameras. If someone 
takes a photo and sends it to me, most of the time it won't want to load it 
and when it eventually decides to load the image properly it won't display 
the image on my phone. Since one of the first updates that has caused this 
frustrating problem a few of my friend's camera photos have decided to be 
downloaded properly and display correctly on my device, but it still seems 
very luck based rather than anything and I haven't yet been able to find a 
solution. I'm also experiencing this problem with messenger lite."
