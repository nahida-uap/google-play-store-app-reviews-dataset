1,"November 17, 2015","What happened Was great. Got this because I almost ran out of minutes. Now it wont call out amd instead uses the phones dialer,  which used the rest of my minutes,, and put me over on my bill, as well as used the credits that I had got turned use this app. Very unhappy!!!"
1,"April 26, 2018"," I loaded this app on my note5. They said you get 25 credits. Nope, only 10. 
Cost 7.5 to sent a text. And that didn't go through to the Ukraine.

1,"August 15, 2016",Poor Connection This app used to be worth while. Now I spend more time trying to make a call than on the call it's self. Constant disconnections are also a norm. Only sticking around until I use up my credit.

5,"September 19, 2016", Very good app I can do international calls for free with the help of the credits and also buy if need more. People who want to do international calls can use this app. To call I alone should have the wifi not the one whom am calling. This feature is really good
