other apps I've tried had the quick reply and the capability to send 
scheduled messages. I think that's pretty standard. So I don't understand 
why this one doesn't. If they add those features it would be a 5 star app

On the S9+ I find this to be a huge upgrade over the stock Samsung messaging.  So many more features with Verizon Messages and have had no issues whatsoever..  On the Windows 10 app, I was concerned initially that messages had not sent, but realized that there is a bit of a delay and I had likely just closed out of the application before they were sent.  The ability to both see messages come in on the computer and respond is fantastic.  There was an issue where on an older message string from before installation, the Windows 10 app is only showing one side of the conversation, but I'm guessing it's just a one-off glitch.

I got a new S7 thru insurance, which I immediately updated to Oreo before transferring everything onto the new S7.  I used Samsung SmartSwitch to back up & transfer my apps & data.  Since then, the  Message+ app (& contacts app)  are entirely missing on my watch.   What I've done: Thoroughly checked and enabled permissions on everything on the watch, and on the phone. Uninstalled & reinstalled WearOS from play store half a dozen times, restarted both devices, and unpaired (factory reset on watch) and set up another half dozen times.   Resynced apps over & over. Searched online for answers & tried allowing native msg svc on phone permissions, even tho I don't use it.   I can't find a way to sync or install these items on my watch, and they are  why I HAVE the watch.

with the monthly service plan. I was having trouble from the very start 
with 1) not receiving messages in a timely manner. Usually appeared in my 
incoming texts the next day 2) A portion of or even all of the text(s) will 
sometimes disappear. In the next day or so, some will reappear as others 
are gone for good. 3) Integrating texts between my cell phone and tablet 
does NOT work. Actually, the above text problems seem to have gotten worse 
after I attempted to integrate. 4) Spam and Block features would really 
come in handy. Please allow us to block a high number of calls/different 
phone #s. Much needed in this day & age of high scams, robocalls, and 
advanced technology. ***PLEASE FIX THESE VERY PROBLEMATIC ISSUES VERY 
QUICKLY AS THEY ARE HINDERING OUR PRODUCTIVITY, AND INCREASING OUR STRESS
