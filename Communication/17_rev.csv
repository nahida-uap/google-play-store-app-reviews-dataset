two public groups that require the new member to message an admin shortly 
after joining, this makes things much more difficult. Especially groups

new members and a private group that acts as the actual group to keep 
trolls and other unwanteds out."

because they thought I was talking to them when I said something rude and 
they left even though I didn't want them to but I couldn't on them and fix 
my mistake"
3,"July 17, 2018"," The new update keeps making the app crash I'm not sure how to make it stop 
without uninstalling and reinstalling it but I don't want to loose all of 
my messages"

something went wrong give it another whirl. Sice I created the account"
1,"July 13, 2018"," After the new update, I'm unable to chat with a new person. Say a member 
from a group, when I click chat, it says Network Not Available even though 
everything else works fine. What the heck is that?"
1,"July 17, 2018"," The latest update has made this app unusable, I am unable to ban or even 
remove anyone from my group nor can I message anyone by selecting from 
within the group"
4,"July 17, 2018"," The update is horrible when someone leaves the chat you can't even talk to 
them anymore unless you pm them before you leave. Why hide the username"
3,"July 20, 2018"," Why can we not pm anyone. Some people have open pms in there name so i 
wouldn like to allow us to have back the ability to talk to someone after 
they leave even if i dont have their accounaccount."

something til you are sure it works or work on the bugs only. i dont know 
what you could have possibly added to make a mistake this bad, but i can 
assure you, its not worth it"
1,"July 18, 2018"," How am I suppose to talk to friends of I keep getting back to back 12 hour 
bans without any explanation behind them? FIX YOUR APP!!! I can't enjoy it 
if I can't even get into the app. Seriously, this is ridiculous."
1,"July 20, 2018"," Always lags and takes too long to open, plus very unstable Needs more 
features like telegram, and themes need to be PER USER, not per chat Too 
many bot accounts, no email verification process You need to fix the app, 
it's going bad"

be possible to find a way to stop people from sending thoes pics?"
2,"July 13, 2018"," the whole update is very annoying, why can't the chat theme be something 
that changes only if you accept it. Then it doesn't change for you but for 
everyone else it does"
3,"July 22, 2018"," This is an ok app, but it's plagued by spambots and fake accounts. Needs a 
block on PM initiation for 24hrs in groups like it has the pic posting 
limit."
1,"July 17, 2018", Got banned for no reason. It'd be a great app if that wasn't that case
3,"July 22, 2018"," I like the app and the new update only thing I don't like about it is when 
someone joins a group chat your in and leave, but you can't chat with them 
once they leave the chat."

gonna move to a better app"
1,"July 13, 2018"," The group themes shouldn't change for everyone, each person should be able

...Full ReviewI've been on kik for over 4 years, and I've watched it improve with things 
like the ability to send 5 pics at once, but the app has hit a new low. To 
start, this app has more glitches than a Bethesda game. On top of that, kik 
seems to be too concerned with policing what people see/do with their 
pointless 24 hour delay on sending pictures. Now on top of that, you can't 
pm someone who's left a group chat. The bots are taking over the app and 
invading public groups, which seems even more harmful than someone possibly 
sending harmful content. The new theme thing is kinda cool, but then you 
realize that it applies to everybody instead of just you, which makes no 
sense. I recommend adding just a client side dark theme (like Discord, the 
app I'm going to be going to now). Last but certainly not least, the bots 
or whatever kik uses to police profile pics and banners is way too 
sensitive. I got temp banned earlier today for changing my pfp to a bunny 
ffs. I really hope kik listens to its userbase and fixes this stuff."
5,"July 13, 2018"," It needs a way to know if the people are on and when u last saw them when 
you delete bots they should stay deactive lol there should also be more 
chat themes!"
1,"July 14, 2018"," This apps sucks right now. I clear as day have internet connection but the 
app keeps telling me I don't. Please fix"
3,"July 13, 2018"," With the latest update, you can no longer message people from a group, 
especially once they've left. Kik is now slower and more frustrating, 
especially for groups."
2,"July 17, 2018"," my phone detects Kik using my microphone almost constantly, even when the 
app is closed and I'm not using it. can you tell me why it's always using 
my microphone?"
5,"July 23, 2018"," It's ok I am a underale role-player and it's a little brutal how people 
treat each other idea is to have a watch over each chat"
2,"July 13, 2018"," All these changes being made to Kik, are not very helpful or progressive, 
and Kik feels like it has regressed actually. What y'all need to do is get 
back right with Jesus. Oh, and I'm trying to make a public chat, and thasss 
not working out for me, due to y'all's end. Hmph..."
3,"July 25, 2018"," The apo is not stable enough yet, the profile pictures and names aren't up 
to date to my app when user updates them. This is a serious issue. Thanks."

something with the bots issue"

having to cut portions of it even tho I don't want to, and theirs no exit 
out of it until I do? What is that. I like kik it's a good app."
1,"July 13, 2018"," Can you stop deleting my conversations when I log out? Its annoying. And if 
you can't then can I at least be able to get then back?"

soon I will be deleting the app"

hindering my ability to meet new friends."

trying to change my damn profile picture?"
4,"July 26, 2018"," I like it but a big problem I have is that it doesn't really tell me when

think there are some things that could be changed/added. first off it would 
be so useful to have a web version of this app that you can use on your pc. 
the fact that all your messages disappear upon logging out is quite 
disturbing, and also that it will only load up to x messages even if you 
haven't logged out - perhaps an option to disable or enable keeping all 
messages could be added? also, the gif keyboard is a bit buggy sometimes, 
oftentimes the gifs i send to the person i'm talking to just look white 
until they tap them. other than that, i think this app really is great, but 
the fact that there's no web version and that the messages disappear

how you can ban me for that when there isn't any picture there to violate 
any Community Standards, the most recent time I got banned for that I was 
trying to change the background picture general and it just wouldn't change 
so I thought maybe the first time they had banned me for no picture was a 
mistake so I removed it so I could try again with the picture I wanted and 
I end up getting banned and I know it wasn't for the picture because it 
didn't show or imply sexual acts, show gore or imply self harm ect. So 
please fix this because it getting highly annoying when you get banned for 
a perfectly fine picture or just not having a picture at all, especially

to send pictures but don't worry, you can send all the useless GIFs you 
need upon entry! This is enough to make this app a one star, but KiK 
Interactive constantly shoots itself in the foot by degrading the app 
further and further as time goes on. (Edit 6/3/17) Again, public groups 
have been removed. A good app is one that is backed by decisive developers. 
If only this app had any of those.. (Edit 6/12/17) constant crashes due to 
inability to handle multiple chats? Not sure how this app has 4.3 stars. 
(Edit 6/17/17) Public groups are almost fully removed, but still highly 
accessible through multiple loopholes. Opening the app is a slow, arduous 
process that leaves me with a black screen to look at while I wait. App 
shuts itself out when I'm typing more often than I'm actually typing. It 
even asks me to force close it when I'm not interacting with it at all. 
(Edit 6/18/17) I am no longer able to message my friends that aren't in the 
active group chats I'm in that I joined through aforementioned loopholes 
that you all overlooked. Even when no one is talking in any chat at all, I 
cannot scroll down my recent conversations without being brought back up to 
the top each time. (Edit 6/20/17) I'm going to have to find a new chat app 
because I can't even open this one anymore. This app is progressively 
getting worse and it's becoming hard for me to defend my use of it. (Edit 
7/29/17) I still cannot message my friend as KiK will not stop auto 
scrolling to the top. This is it, bois. The worst official approved app you 
can possibly download. (Edit 8/22/17) leaving any group freezes KiK for 
about two minutes each time. Downhill is the direction you guys decided to 
take while you ""constantly update"" your app. (edit 9/23/17) learned a group 
admin or owner can add bias to your forty eight hour group ban by 
repeatedly banning and unbanning to any individual account at their will. 
(edit 11/15/17) app crashes every fifteen seconds. Barely able to hold 
conversations with friends now. (edit 7/12/18) Usernames are now encrypted?

to send pictures but don't worry, you can send all the useless GIFs you 
need upon entry! This is enough to make this app a one star, but KiK 
Interactive constantly shoots itself in the foot by degrading the app 
further and further as time goes on. (Edit 6/3/17) Again, public groups 
have been removed. A good app is one that is backed by decisive developers. 
If only this app had any of those.. (Edit 6/12/17) constant crashes due to 
inability to handle multiple chats? Not sure how this app has 4.3 stars. 
(Edit 6/17/17) Public groups are almost fully removed, but still highly 
accessible through multiple loopholes. Opening the app is a slow, arduous 
process that leaves me with a black screen to look at while I wait. App 
shuts itself out when I'm typing more often than I'm actually typing. It 
even asks me to force close it when I'm not interacting with it at all. 
(Edit 6/18/17) I am no longer able to message my friends that aren't in the 
active group chats I'm in that I joined through aforementioned loopholes 
that you all overlooked. Even when no one is talking in any chat at all, I 
cannot scroll down my recent conversations without being brought back up to 
the top each time. (Edit 6/20/17) I'm going to have to find a new chat app 
because I can't even open this one anymore. This app is progressively 
getting worse and it's becoming hard for me to defend my use of it. (Edit 
7/29/17) I still cannot message my friend as KiK will not stop auto 
scrolling to the top. This is it, bois. The worst official approved app you 
can possibly download. (Edit 8/22/17) leaving any group freezes KiK for 
about two minutes each time. Downhill is the direction you guys decided to 
take while you ""constantly update"" your app. (edit 9/23/17) learned a group 
admin or owner can add bias to your forty eight hour group ban by 
repeatedly banning and unbanning to any individual account at their will. 
(edit 11/15/17) app crashes every fifteen seconds. Barely able to hold 
conversations with friends now. (edit 7/12/18) Usernames are now encrypted? 
Is there even a public changelog...?"
3,"July 12, 2018"," Used to be one of my favorite apps. But since the update group chats dont
