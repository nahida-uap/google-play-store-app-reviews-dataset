We always used it as our main messaging app for our phones. Recently 
though, most of us havent been getting notified of when we get messages on 
the app, and it would only notify while its open in the background or if 
someone actually texts my phone itself it will then notify me of Telegram 
too. It is becoming really annoying as we have to constantly check the app 
to make sure we arent missing any messages since we dont get notified. If 
this can be fixed that would be great! We all have Samsung phones and most

features that some good e-mail programmes already have? Like adding the 
possibility for delayed transmission of texts in Version 4.8.11.? Thanks! 
PS: Also, could you pls stop sending these notifications if new friends pop 
up there? We all have our address books synced already. - So even if you 
are proud to reach more people now (which is great for each one of us) and 
since this could be a useful feature pls reduce it to some other form. Or 
just put it somewhere else other than the notification bar, alright? (I 
mean there must be forms to do that without having to change the whole user 
interface and design...Right?) PPS: And btw what about your emoticons? I 
would have almost refrained from using it in the beginning because there is 
not enough diversity (what about all us POCs/red-hairs/LGBTQs within your 
users?) - although of course your technology is (right now) still the most 
advanced. PPPS: And WHY does it often directly upload data to the server 
but not also directly on to the receiver (unless you still have your Wi-Fi 
on)? This can not solely be a hard ware problem regarding your means of 
transmission, right? I think maybe you should refine that whole part in 
your software's algorithm there for the next version..."
