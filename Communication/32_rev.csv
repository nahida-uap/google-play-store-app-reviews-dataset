Zangi is much better than what I expected, with same network WhatsApp was not able to deliver my texts, where as using zangi , I was able to make video calls in low data mode. I'm rating 4 start because there is one thing which bothers me while chatting I checked the connections made by zangi and I found 2 ip addresses one connection was static while the other one was hopping the IP addresses. And none of those were my partners IP addresses. On zangi's website i saw peer to peer written, and I'm confused now that if zangi works peer to peer then why zangi is making connections to those IPs. Are those IP addresses are used to form a route between me and my partner? And when the route is available the messages get sent via that route ? I'd like to know more about this. Because I known its possible to have peer to peer IM app without need of any server. Earlier I did it as a hobby project. I'd like to know if its truely peer to peer .  apart from this zangi beats Facebook owned WhatsApp. And now zangi will be my primary IM app and I'd be suggesting my friends to join zangi if they need to contact me.

Very quick. 👍  But when I first installed it, I couldn't get any calls or messages. Then I force stopped the apo and opened it. Works like a charm. But it happened again.. 😕  UI of this app is better than most of the apps. That's for sure. 👍  This app surely uses less data, but call quality is not the best and had some weird hiccups.  My video always try to change between light and dark picture so it's not very pleasant. 😰  Overall, not a bad app."
3,"November 17, 2017", I have an issue with the notification. Notification doesn't show up. I already give permission to run at startup and run in the background but still I have to open the app first before I can receive any messages. Can anyone tell me how to fix this?
4,"November 3, 2017", Good app.log out option is very usefull one.video compression nd send full length video is great..i only suggestion is add status optn like watsap and Mention a message optn too😊😊 90% ok app ..

I wanted to like and use this app to replace Facebook Messenger, Messenger is turning in to another Social Networking app like FB and I can't stand it. I hoped Zangi could replace it. I finally got my sister to install it. On my phone it doesn't show her as a contact, not I on her phone, the app keeps disabling itself. So I have had to reregister it many times, only for it to disable itself again. I sent requests in for help and have had no replies. Zangi wants to be a Skype killer, and as much as I despise Microsoft, Skype works. It works very well. The only think I have been able to do with Zangi is install it. Nothing else works on it for me or my sister, she on iPhone, me Android."

1,"April 17, 2017", How to invait the zangi account people example my wife have and me but I  can't faind my wife account how it's please explain me because I have two r three friends account in zangi
5,"April 9, 2017", Just a wonderful app all around better than all other video call apps tried them all . One minor detail i thought would make it better is to have a little louder voice reception
1,"April 15, 2017", This is very too much cheating app i will do zangi video call hacking simply
5,"April 11, 2017", Good software better than others. But net usage is very high. Eg:half an hour talking with Zangi 600MB.but other SW just 150 only.
