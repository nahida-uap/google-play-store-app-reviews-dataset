nothing shows up to notify me there is a new Signal message waiting. 
Frustrating, especially when messages are of an urgent nature. There is 
nothing wrong with my phone notification system. The fault is with Signal. 
The classic text messaging app which comes with every phone gives no

2,"July 12, 2018"," Edit: since the latest update I don't get notifications, even though 
notifications are supposed to be switched on. Pretty good, but I can't send 
gifs unless I restart my phone - every single time - which is quite 
annoying."
5,"July 17, 2018"," I love this app! It is a very easy SMS to use. It works easily with the

1,"July 18, 2018", For Pete's sake please stop making Android see the signal part of the  contact as a type 'other' as it breaks many things! This is driving me  crazy i.e. it breaks Google voice dialling in the car.
5,"July 16, 2018", Close the background task to reduce battery drain. Very happy with Signal!

1,"July 24, 2018"," Very limited messenger app. But the worst bid is it freezes and my phone

useless emoticon button that I never use."

too. Unless they come, it's of no use"
1,"July 23, 2018"," Please do not waste time as not gettting sms for varification and dont get 
calls its waste of time data and time both. Developers seems crazy"

the multi view. Devices tested: Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge."
3,"July 23, 2018"," It doesn't work without contact sharing. It's impossible to add any contact 
manually without giving permissions to contacts. It has no lock."
2,"July 18, 2018"," Please restore the ability to import and export SMS messages in an 
unencrypted format compatible with SMS Backup & Restore. Without this

that never sends... ugh"
5,"July 18, 2018"," The app is awesome! Privacy for the people. Now it should enable group 
calling and the interface be even more intuitive so the app can compete 
with Facebook messenger and other big ones. Once this happens more and more 
people will use it!"

they are typing! Otherwise, it's a pretty good social media messaging app!"
5,"July 10, 2018"," Cool.app and bored of using whtsapp and this has a disappearing feature 
which is good sometimes and very clear and easy to use app and secure too 
Good job team !!!"
3,"July 23, 2018"," It can't display plain text as sent in Txt file by iPhone and it s showing 
file signal..txt. IPhone would display full text from txt file correctly 
instead of attachment signal... Txt file as in Android phones."
5,"July 25, 2018"," Excellent program and highly recommend it. The encryption messaging between 
two people once paired is so much more secure than that in Messenger. Well 
done a top app."
5,"July 13, 2018"," I recently switched from another messaging app to this one. I feel it's 
more secure, and it works flawlessly. I love it!"
5,"July 19, 2018"," It's an excellent and refined application which give you as good ux

secure way. I adopted it."

A few months later and this is still working great for me."
5,"July 13, 2018"," This is simpler in user interface fancies, but better for privacy and 
security. And simpler isn't a negative. It very much does what it's 
intended for."
1,"July 14, 2018", I hate this app. Never get messages on time.
5,"July 21, 2018"," Love using this, the only downside I've found is that it and Messages 
process SMS in Android Auto even with Signal as my default. Everything else 
is great"
4,"July 25, 2018"," Great for group chat. Not so great for use with all hands free devices 
during driving"
5,"July 16, 2018"," I actually like it and have no complaints so far. Video calls r better 
quality than snapchat or messenger"
5,"July 23, 2018"," Works better then messenger. Knowing that no peeping Tom or uncle Sam can 
gain access either. Great black out theme too!"
4,"July 20, 2018", Great! My only complaint is that the ui feels a bit out of date
5,"July 21, 2018"," Easy to use app, even friends like to use them, when you explain to them 
what privacy is about. Becoming more and more popular..."
5,"July 25, 2018", Fantastic. Keep encrypting and not storing metadata and ill be happy.
5,"July 11, 2018"," I use it every day for all messaging (100% of my SMS, MMS, and outgoing 
video calls)."
4,"July 18, 2018"," Call quality is spotty at best. Basic functionality is acceptable but not 
frilly."
4,"July 19, 2018"," It is basically WhatsApp but not owned by Facebook and lacking many 
features that make WhatsApp even more attractive. Otherwise it is quick and 
easy to use."
1,"July 24, 2018", Won't stop asking me to rate the app
5,"July 11, 2018"," Love open source and security. If you do too, this is your best option. As 
good as most text messaging apps"
1,"July 24, 2018"," Good app, but almost impossible to get friends to migrate from WhatsApp 
without in-line formatting like *bold*, _italics_ and ~strikethrough~."
5,"July 13, 2018"," With a transparent and 100% open source approach to data security and 
encryption, this app is a simple and effective way to communicate securely."
4,"July 20, 2018", Crashes often but at least its encrypted
5,"July 15, 2018"," It's great, my only complaint would be the ability to send larger vid files 
or such over it"
5,"July 22, 2018", More people should be aware of privacy concerns and use this app
4,"July 22, 2018"," Apesar de que tengo bloqueada la opci√≥n de tomar screenshot si le permite 
al otro usuario hacerlo"
5,"July 24, 2018"," Simple and intuitive design makes the app user friendly for all ages. 
Secure, end-to-end encryption keeps your conversations private."
4,"July 15, 2018"," Would've given five stars if you could search for text in all 
conversations. Seems like a simple feature to add."
5,"July 11, 2018"," Pretty great app tbh, it is missing some small features of other apps, but 
it has everything you actually need."
5,"July 19, 2018", Try to convince your friends it's worth it ;)
4,"July 25, 2018"," Excellent app, only issue is that it needs a lot more stable connection 
compared to the likes of WhatsApp to send out and receive messages"
1,"July 14, 2018", Worst app not even logging in.
5,"July 15, 2018", We dont need no water!
5,"July 26, 2018"," Great app, encryption only works if both parties use the Signal app. Can't 
beat open source either."
3,"July 23, 2018"," Not clear how to attach a picture. It does not have a banner to tell me if 
I got a message."
5,"July 21, 2018"," As a messaging app, it does everything you need flawlessly. And then bonus 
end to end encryption is nice"
5,"July 18, 2018"," It just works smoothly and as expected. I really appriciate your work ! 
Thank you for the commitment and developing that app !"
4,"July 23, 2018"," Private, simple, and not bloated. However the import/export option is gone."
5,"July 16, 2018"," I only get an icon notification on my app when there is more than 1 message 
waiting."
3,"July 19, 2018"," but i don't get its push notifications which is kinda weird. apart from 
that, best messaging app, hands down!"
4,"July 20, 2018"," Very good security and privacy, but when I send messages to iPhone users, 
it doesn't sound the warning as WhatsApp does."
5,"July 15, 2018"," Have finally found the replacer for whatsapp, telegram and messenger! 
Syncing of web and app could be improved still."

etc and make everyone I know download it."

3,"July 11, 2018"," Since last update, I am not getting notifications. I have to open the app 
to know if I got a message."
5,"July 15, 2018", Couldn't ask for a better app
4,"July 18, 2018"," I feel much more secure with this app. It works great, as well as my 
previous messaging apps."

works."

high picture quality."
4,"July 24, 2018", Video chat not the best.
2,"July 14, 2018", Not getting verification code help me
4,"July 16, 2018"," Security is most important nowadays especially on text messaging. Simple to 
use good alternative to messenger recommended app."
4,"July 20, 2018"," I like it but I sometimes loose messages sent to me from other messaging 
apps."
4,"July 9, 2018", The app is good but lacks the ability to set automatic download of images.
5,"July 15, 2018"," Very clear when the person on the other end is also using signal that the 
messages are secure."
3,"July 22, 2018"," It gives me confidence about securing messages, but compared to other 
applications, needs a lot of work."
5,"July 16, 2018"," My opinion of Signal is that it's awesome. I like being able to use it as 
my main messaging app."
4,"July 13, 2018", Does just about everything that your regular app does.
5,"July 12, 2018"," Lightweight app, great for private secure messaging, also doubles up as a 
very good and minimalist SMS app."

Windows client is extremely slow to start."

also can't figure out how to set a timer to send out a text at a later 
time. Otherwise the app works pretty well. It has a great choice of emojis"
2,"July 18, 2018"," Very slow app. Messages take too much time to get delivered. Notifications

of appearance, but overall disliked the app"

should I don't know maybe call. Not open the dialer app, put the number in 
then piece out like a union worker. ""Well that's not technically my job""."

and why can't I encrypt/hide some messages..?"

the issue? Why should it be an issue?"
5,"July 3, 2018"," It's not Messenger it's not WhatsApp - so that's a good start. I have my 
private messaging and my SMS going through Signal and it's seamless / 
hassle-free."
5,"June 30, 2018"," Works perfectly. Not as commonly used as WhatsApp, which makes the 
selection of people you can contact via it slightly less."

call few times later but after putting such code its showing code is 
invalid.......just irritating"
5,"July 7, 2018"," Honestly don't get why people are still using other data-stealing apps to 
communicate. You don't have to be too worried about your privacy to

better with any other messaging app."

coming through but seems to be fixed."
5,"July 6, 2018"," Me and my friends are all slowly migrating towards Signal. It's not 
perfect, but it's the only usable thing that even comes close to having an 
acceptable level of security."
4,"July 1, 2018"," Only thing I dislike is setting my desired ringtone and having it stay 
without it going back to default"
5,"July 2, 2018"," I found one annoyance, when replying from the notification my message 
sometimes is sent as SMS instead as a signal message"
5,"July 3, 2018"," Great app. Still lacks in a strong user base but I hope that changes in the 
near future."
4,"July 13, 2018"," Give us the ability to increase the font size using the volume buttons and 
the ability to have more then one attachment per text. Give us the ability 
to lock messages so they cannot be deleted. Thank you."

install you might need to keep foreign people be aware of Signal because 
not everyone knows about signal and"

finish it n send the message. Thanks!"
2,"July 1, 2018"," Why do notifications STILL only work half the time.... File sizes have to 
be small. Messages get delivered way late if at all...."
4,"July 4, 2018"," It's an ok app, but misses some key features from competitors like a direct 
contact widget or previews of video uploaded."

5,"July 3, 2018"," Clean and simple, covers all the basics you need. Security/encryption 
features are a nice addition. And you can't beat free."
4,"July 3, 2018", Lock screen doesnt work on android

get the phone call function to work without success I have to knock my 
rating down a star. Note that I did contact their support as well as a 
unofficial support forum. Support points the finger at the firewall (all 
udp ports have to be open, and they were when I tested). Other VOIP apps 
work (skype). Other users report similar issues with no sign from OWS that 
they are working on it."
1,"June 23, 2018"," You used to be able to import AND export SMS in the app, but now you can 
only import. I love Signal, but I don't love being forced to stay with it 
or lose my messages!"
4,"June 30, 2018"," Loved this ap until a message popped up telling someone was trying to 
intercept my messages or my friend was reinstalling the ap. How do you 
really KNOW that no one can read your messages?"
2,"June 28, 2018"," Please restore the ability to lock this app without the need to lock the 
whole phone. It's a major inconvenience to have to lock my whole phone just 
to be able to lock this app. Also, if the phone lock code is the same as 
the app lock code, that's not very secure."
4,"June 27, 2018"," My VPN does not let signal work but whatsapp works... But I would really 
like to use it more like Google Hangouts as far as mostly from my desktop."
5,"June 25, 2018"," Definitely one of the best encrypted messaging apps out there. I know some 
of you might not agree but in my opinion this app is a million times better 
than WhatsApp and Telegram."
3,"June 23, 2018"," Great design and security - but the damn messages come in at random times, 
all at once, often hours after they've been sent. Please fix this!"
4,"June 25, 2018"," Good for secure messages, but not as a full sms replacement. It cannot 
accept emergency messages, and playing video or audio clips doesn't work. 
But, still good for what it was built for."

that it wouldn't."

I'll take it üòÅ"
3,"June 26, 2018"," This app is pretty secure in terms of encryption, but being unable to 
export text messages for use in other apps is a major deal breaker"

restore a backup of conversations from previous phone. Have tried many 
times."

send multiple pics -Feature to delete all messages of a single chat, and 
maybe the possibility to choose which chats not to automatically delete 
messages older than X from (in the current version it applies to all chats) 
-Possibility to change Chat backgrounds I gave already five stars cause I 
want more and more people to join Signal and care about their privacy. Hope 
my review may be useful, thanks a lot for your work."

improved I guess. Keep up the good work OWS !"

sure your mother-in-law is using something else (!) ;-) THIS APP IS OPEN

they're all checked."

In group texts with non Signal users, sometimes Signal can't retrieve MMS images they send and it shows up as a text from the individual with a message saying couldn't retrieve MMS and click to retry. But it times out. I had Signal crash while doing this and it then crashed every time on starting, even after reboot. I had to uninstall and reinstall, but I LOST ALL MY TEXTS as a result. Also, sending to a group you have to create a group and give it a name. But you can not see/reference this group ever again by name. Also, I created a group and sending failed to all members every time until I removed some members. No explanation why.  Update.  If one of your friends installs Signal and then uninstalls it....or gets a new phone and does not install it, then you can never talk to them again with Signal.  You send messages and/or call and it just goes into a black hole.  There is no way to manually tell Signal to switch back to SMS for a user when you know they no longer have Signal.  I am lowering my review from 2 stars to 1 star for this one."

Clean interface, other than the prompt to rate it - Group chats are 
possible - Open source so anyone can audit its security Cons: - Can't sync 
old messages to new devices - Can't backup encryption for 
switching/resetting devices; contacts always get warned of safety numbers 
changing - Can't encrypt SMS messages - Group chats have almost no 
management features - Main developer's hostility towards alternative 
clients and federation makes me wonder why they release the source in the 
first place Overall, Signal is the best app to communicate with people via 
the Signal protocol. But I prefer Telegram for a nicer interface, openness 
to fostering a community of contributors, the ability to backup and restore 
app data, and more features in general."
3,"June 23, 2018", Message backups stopped working a few months ago and still don't work.

apps. May be a phone setting, not sure"
4,"July 24, 2018"," There is no option of sending multiple pictures together. We have to select

way around!"

4,"July 1, 2018"," Accidentally delete a message and it can't be restored. Archive, although 
referenced, does not exist. No undo."
3,"July 21, 2018"," It would be a great app if all messages were delivered to everyone all the 
time. I also wonder how private it actually is. I've had ads aimed at me 
after using it. Still using it though."
2,"July 2, 2018"," For a privacy-centric app, this app asks for too many permissions. Cannot 
use without giving it a permanent phone number."
4,"July 4, 2018"," It does what it's designed to do but adding an existing contact isn't very 
intuitive."
1,"June 25, 2018", 'secure' app asking for  45 permissions is a bad joke .... and looks more like a scam to me

and want a minimalistic functionality for ease of use."

typing, selecting multiple images, make it a little bit faster"
4,"June 26, 2018"," I use this to communicate with someone who requested I use it. It's as easy

for it."

Besides that, it does everything I need and does it with Open Source and for free!"
5,"June 19, 2018"," Great app but still needs some basic stuff. Haven't found any easy way to 
copy the number from unknown contacts for example, a bit weird. And still 
needs a broader userbase to be really effective. Too many ppl still uses 
WhatsApp as primary app."

relevant parties, including state/government actors with the authority to 
issue subpoenas and warrants. The fact that even the US government has now 
approved it's use for members of Congress I think says a lot about relevant
