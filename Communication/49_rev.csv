First off, whenever I try to send a text message/SMS, it takes an awfully long time for it to be delivered. I have already made sure that I didn't have any delayed sending turned on. Please fix this issue. It's been more than 5 minutes for a simple ""Hello"" to be sent. Thank you. Please resolve this ASAP."
5,"March 9, 2017"," The app has some awesome features.. Problem which you must address is that message notifications are not there.. In the meantime, I will uninstall it."
2,"March 5, 2017", Thought it was working great until I realized I'm still not getting all my notifications :( now it also force closes again on my HTC desire...think  I will just stick to the native app
5,"May 10, 2017", Would you make it possible to group chat where the participants can send their replies into one message instead of separately inboxing the sender.

First off, whenever a new text comes it wakes the screen and keeps it awake permanently until I respond or dismiss it. This is despite even having the ""Wake screen"" option turned off in settings. It is super annoying since it causes a lot of battery drainage for screen on time. For instance I've had texts come in at night when I'm asleep only to find the screen still on and my battery down about 30%! The feature for turning on screen on new text is okay but should only be momentary as per system screen time out settings. Secondly everytime I send a text the phone vibrates and I can't seem to find a way to turn the feature off. I know I have hit send, I don't need a physical confirmation.   Once these 2 issues are fixed I'll def give a 5-star rating coz I totally love the app. Until then I've had to disable it and revert to my former SMS app. Please get the screen issue fixed ASAP.  Thanks."
4,"March 13, 2017",Loving it but.. Add the feature of delay time when sending a text like that of gosms
