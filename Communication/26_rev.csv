draw pictures and this became a way for her to do so and to be creative and 
social with not only me, but members of her family. It helps her to keep in 
contact more with her grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. One thing 
that shes really into is being able to text her her dad at work. With that 
said theres. HUGE issue with the video calling. When she or myself tries to 
video call when you answer the call it doesnt go through. The call continue 
to ring through. Also if you happen to not answer it continues to ring. But 
never connects. Something to fix."

when shes at sleep overs without the worry of the wrong person being able 
to talk to her. The only thing is ide like if our chat boxes were differnt 
colours as it confuses her a bit she said.."
4,"July 17, 2018"," I like the app. My son uses it to write or call me when I'm at work. I 
think he feels like a big boy using it. A couple of issues I have with it 
though is I can't seem to Facetime him but he can facetime me which I think 
is odd. Also I can barely hear him when he calls. Audio is extremely low."

free, and as soon as it's available for us I'll be switching as long as 
Monster Messenger still has ads."
5,"July 14, 2018"," My mum got this for me cause its a good way to keep your children safe when 
you are calling. Some people are right about the calling thing it doesnt 
let you answer you need to fix it but overall its really good!!"

now. Would have been nice to know before I got this app, or even after...I 
could have loaded my sons phone up with the credits. Extremely 
disappointing. Video chat was literally the only reason I got him a phone

to navigate. I am not a huge fan of all the bots, etc that I have to 
unsubscribe to and the point system for calling. It makes it seem a little 
more comes than it needs to be. I would be willing to pay for this app to 
have a simpler experience. It's a super idea and we'll put together so far. 
My daughter loves it and feels so grown up texting with her family and a 
few friends. Looking forward to more from this app!!"

members at the same time."

4,"May 11, 2018"," I don't like the fact that my son was banned for 24 hours from the app, but 
that I never received any info explaining to me why. I check my kids 
accounts daily, but there should be a message letting parents know if this 
happens."
5,"May 4, 2018"," Monster messenger is a great way for children to keep in touch with friends

Very frustrating."
5,"April 29, 2018"," It is slightly difficult to set up, however, I like this so that my kids

1,"April 30, 2018"," I used to really like this app until they added video bots to my kid's

We really like how the parent account needs to approve each contact on the childs account. The initial setup to connect to friends is fiddly. We sent invitations a few times before we could get friends (and family) synced up properly, this area definately needs some more work as I feel you may lose potential users because of it. Once setup and friends are linked its easy to use for any age."
5,"April 2, 2018"," Great app for staying connected with our kids. People can't add the kids without me being notified. Super easy to use. It has these 'bots' that send random messages that are kind of annoying. You can unfriend/delete them, can't disable completely, so that's annoying, but really the only drawback."

She loves being creative with stickers, sending her own pics, and the safe image search to find things to attach. However, the invite process in the beginning is a little confusing. Betty & Roxy & Freddie used by the app to notify us of things shd be explained in the description. I had to hunt in the FAQs to figure it out. And the bots  seem unnecessary. Kids r creative enough without needing their ideas, plus I'd rather have my child  share and ""collect"" ideas/favorites from the people i allow her to connect with only....not random youtube contributors, etc.... though they are safe, I'd rather have her focused on connecting than watching videos. The app has plenty of wonderful features without it."
4,"March 16, 2018", I like it a lot. I wish there was some sort of wifi calling feature. I like that I can approve/deny whoever tries to add him. My boy likes the GIFs and stickers. Its pretty good if you want something simple.
2,"March 31, 2018", good app but notifications need improvement especially new requests for parents approval. the app icon is ugly. video style facetime would be great especially when the kids want face to face time with grandparents

I was able to communicate very easily with my kids and it was fun and safe. In the past couple of weeks though, there seems to be some sort of issue with sending and receiving messages. I get emails that I've received a message but when I open the app, there are no new messages. When I try to message my kids, the text stays a light color, indictating to me that the message was not sent. I hope this issue gets resolved because until this, it was a great app."
3,"March 11, 2018"," Update: i can see it pop up and tell me a message, but I can't see the message in the app.  Very disappointed.    Worked great until the last week or so.  I get notification that there is a message, but it's not there in the app or messages don't go through at all"
5,"March 9, 2018", This app is good because I have a tablet and this makes it where I can text my mom and she  dose not let me have Facebook messager but she said I can have Monster Messager because it is kid friendly
3,"March 14, 2018", The app was cute at first but now I can't read any messages that have been sent to me. I get the notification and the email I have a message but yet when I go into the app there is no message. Yes I have uninstalled and re-downloaded.
3,"March 10, 2018", I have two daughters. I was able to get it to work with one of them and it works wonderfully! I love it! But I only gave it 3 stars because we can't figure out how to get it to work with my other daughter.
5,"March 16, 2018", This app is actually really cute and user friendly ‚ù§Ô∏è you can record voice messages and send funny pictures. I'm glad my kids have this
5,"March 10, 2018", It's great I love to talk to my kids whenever I want and she can talk to her friend whenever she wants its way better than Roo Kids
4,"March 13, 2018", The apps is great and I'd give it 5 stars but Betty won't stop saying invite your family and friwnds fix this please or I will be deleting it
5,"March 12, 2018", This is a useful app because you can talk to your friends and family about problems
5,"March 12, 2018", This is really nice because I tried regular messager and it's boring so thumbs up!
5,"March 10, 2018", I love this app soo much!! I can keep in touch with my friends even when I'm at my mum's house! I recommend it üòÄ
4,"March 14, 2018", it is a great safe way for kids to talk but it would be nice if we could send videos

5,"July 23, 2018", Its good
5,"March 10, 2018", brilliant
5,"March 4, 2018", I the security it had. The parent has to accept invites for children so random creepy people can't just add them and talk to them. I moved to Mexico about a year ago and this app let's me stay in contact with my nephews and nieces back in America.
5,"March 7, 2018", Great app the kids love it would recommend to anyone nice and safe for the kids there only one thing I would like to see added to this app is a way to restrict them from using it at certain times like bed time and to do homework but apart from that great everyone loves it
5,"March 9, 2018", Use this app to communicate safely  with my grandkids .They love the stickers and voice messages we can send back and forth to each other . And mom and dad have peace of mind  their safety online.
5,"February 27, 2018", Perfect for my 8 year old to feel connected with her buddies outside of school. It's also great for her to text and chat with family all around the world. I thinks she's recruited half the school. Great app so far.
4,"March 5, 2018"," Its great but as an 11 year old going to a secondary school and leaving my friends (also, I don't have a phone) its hard to communicate as we are so far away, also, saying you have to be 13 is a bad idea because people like me aren't allowed to be a child and make an account as you said it is 6-8 ye...Full ReviewIts great but as an 11 year old going to a secondary school and leaving my friends (also, I don't have a phone) its hard to communicate as we are so far away, also, saying you have to be 13 is a bad idea because people like me aren't allowed to be a child and make an account as you said it is 6-8 years old, not very happy!!!!!!"
5,"March 7, 2018"," I looove this app. I recently moved away from home, and this app has made it easier for me to stay in touch with my 8 YO neice. Its such a great alternative to facebook messenger or whats app, because it gives parents complete control!"
5,"March 4, 2018", My kids have really loved having a way to be in contact with us from their tablets while at sleep overs or just in a different part of the house. It's been great fun decorating the photos and sending them.
5,"March 6, 2018", Well I think this is the best monster messenger app because it's for kids and you have to now people's names to get them so you can't just get them strait away and yeah it's just the best message app for kids
3,"March 4, 2018", My friends don't come on monster messangger and i sent them invatations but it is fun to draw and create pictures so yeah!üñí
5,"March 6, 2018"," I love this app, being able to keep in touch with my kids and having control over who they talk to is very important at a young age. Keep up the good work."
4,"March 3, 2018", Very nice features. Would be better if  it supported Dutch language. Some very normal Dutch words are interpreted as swearing.
5,"March 1, 2018", This app has been fantastic for my kids to communicate with their dad at home and with me when at their dad's. I can monitor who and what they are adding. Highly recommended!

5,"February 28, 2018", This is the most perfect app to keep in touch with our grandchildren.  Plus it helps them to spell.
2,"April 2, 2018", this app stopped and now I can not text my mom or friends

Until this point I have been singing the praises of this app. My kids and extended family love it for staying in touch. Please fix this. I cannot let my children use this with such a massive safety flaw. A parent set pin would be much safer in my opinion.
5,"February 5, 2018", So far so good seems safe enough for my kids! Love the fact i can vet people before my children can accept friends and block if needed! My kids love it telling there friends to get it! They can't keep off the app as they love the fact they can text there friends even without a SIM card!!
1,"February 17, 2018"," We thought this app was great until our kids showed us that they have full access to search nd watch YouTube within this app! I am so disappointed!! We have deleted it from all of our devices. This app is NOT SAFE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!"
5,"February 15, 2018", A great little app for connecting with kids. My daughter loves it and is beginning to type now rather than just speak. Only suggestion is to make the GIF search function a little easier to navigate. I can't work it out and I'm a grown up!
5,"February 8, 2018", This is the best thing that happened to my 6 yr old son. He can now chat with me and other family members in a safe and secured environment.
5,"February 12, 2018", Great kid friendly messenger. No ads or anything they can accidentally download or buy. Works on wifi. I let my daughter use an old phone of mine until she's old enough to have one of her own with a network and plan.
5,"February 7, 2018"," I am so happy to be able to text my twin daughters whenever I want.  The app is cute and very easy to use.  It's a great way to be even closer to my daughters and it helps with improving their reading, drawing, and writing skills."

This is very useful for my kids when I need to make a quick trip outside without them, but the walkie talkie style of voip is a bit halting. It would be nice to directly call my kid with my own wifi connection or cellular data connection. If the app is updated to include a more substantial calling feature I will give it five stars. I know a lot of parents who would love this app even more if it included a calling feature, especially due to the fact that there are no other apps like this around. It's easy to add your kids and edit their contact list and approve who they talk to. This is wonderful for my kids and I in that we do not have to get an email for everyone, or sign up for a Facebook or Google account to add them. Thanks!!! Amazing app!"
4,"February 17, 2018"," Got the app so my 7 year old can message me when I'm at work, seems nice and secure ( I random people asking to message etc), only annoying bit are the daily messages from the app itself"

1,"February 3, 2018"," Love the app in theory but yesterday no sent messages were received by either my daughter or myself. Leaving a 1 star because there is also no customer support, message fail feedback on the app or service status info anywhere. You just don't know messages aren't being received."
3,"February 1, 2018", the app itself is very good but I am currently abroad and my 8yr old is at home with his mom. when I try and send him photos it says http server error..

5,"February 1, 2018"," It's perfect for communicating with my 10 yr old. The only complaint I have is it's only WiFi enabled so if I'm on the road and want to text my son whose home, my text won't send with data plan."

I love that my daughter can do this without phone service and just a WiFi connection. The parental approvals for friend requests is an amazing feature. My 6yo is staying connected with family while practicing her spelling and communication skills! What more could I want?
2,"February 4, 2018", I'm having a bad experience mg daughter has been asking me for a texting app i thought this was gonna be great! But... There's an issue she LOVES stickers and things so she doesn't like the ones u guys have so she has to use emojis also U should add fonts and more tool to drawing
5,"January 26, 2018", This app is really cool!!! I get to talk to my kids privately. It's actually a little better than normal messenger.
5,"February 2, 2018", Great way to get in touch with family and friends I have 1 complaint you need WiFi to text other than that great to get in touch with family and friends
5,"January 30, 2018"," Awesome app, let's my 10 year old text Mom Dad and grandma without being able to talk to strangers or add friends without my approval. Wish I found it sooner!"
5,"February 3, 2018"," Great way to communicate with daughter while away on the road. As a parent you can approve friends, and get notified as each new friend is added. You can change notification sounds, send photos, video, share gifs, stickers, and draw. Pretty cool and safe!"
3,"January 31, 2018", I think this app Is really cool but betty does not listen and nor does rocky and I think that betty should choose my picturesüòàüòàüòàüòà I am telling you please fix this

4,"January 26, 2018", There are so many games notifications piling on my daugters notification panel that she often misses new messages from this. Please add a homescreen widget so that she wont miss any of my messages

4,"January 28, 2018"," I like it, but I feel that the constant messages from computer messengers is annoying and unnecessary."
5,"January 25, 2018", I have an Android and my 10 year old has an IPod so when she's away at her dad's I can keep in touch everyday!
5,"January 24, 2018"," This app is perfect, it allows my son to ""text me"" but I know he is perfectly safe as I choose who he connects with"
5,"January 23, 2018", I love that this app allows me to approve or block anyone who attempts to connect with my son.
5,"January 24, 2018", Great for kids it is just like messenger but for kids I love it and I got my cuz into it and she loves it
5,"January 26, 2018", Downloaded this app as a way for my kids and I to keep in touch with family. It's awesome and the kids love it.
5,"January 25, 2018", It's really good because I can text Summer and stuff
5,"January 23, 2018", Very good.i like that it's mainly for children and their parents.

5,"January 19, 2018", I love that my 7 year old can text my husband or myself but cannot text strangers. All of his contacts must first be approved by me. He even texted me his spelling words as another way to practice them. There sre No advertisements!

Do you not see how your putting kids in danger?
3,"January 18, 2018", This seems a fairly good way for my 5yr old son to keep in touch with family and i can keep an eye on it all too. Not so happy that we don't seem to get notifications when a message arrives though.

Some parents have down rated the app for that reason but it is actually a positive thing because it is not normal for a child to keep being told to check an inbox in an unatural way. We need to think about their habits and notfications can distract and break thought processes. Good work devs.
4,"January 1, 2018", Took a while to get set up but the app does work well. The kiddo loves it as I travel and she is too you to have a phone. So she texts me here with her iPod.
4,"January 22, 2018", Wanted something where my 6yr old daughter could message me through her tablet but stopped weirdos been able to message her. This app does the job. I have to accept contacts. It's easy to work. My daughter feels like a grown up. Only downside us daughter can't take a pic and send it to me.
5,"January 7, 2018"," I really like being able to stay up to date with my grandchildren, without the fear of them being trolled.  Great way for children to learn how to use social media before they get into a place where there is no ""taking it back""."

5,"January 20, 2018", LOVE THIS!! You should deffeniltly get it for any one of any age!! I don't have a negative thing to say..( honestly )
4,"January 5, 2018", This is a great app to communicate with my son if he's at home with family & I'm at work. I just wish it showed the times of the messages & provided better notifications of messages & supported notifications on Amazon Fire tablets. Get those 2 items fixed & you get 5 stars for sure!
5,"January 18, 2018", This app is amazing I can keep in touch with my mom when she works. It has stickers and you can chat with people without being friends and their are boots to help you but sometimes they will go on a loop and keep on typing the same thing over and over agian
5,"January 17, 2018", I love this but im sad you cant call sadly ut the graffics are the best im into it and im talkinng to a girl named amaya and she is vary nice and i really hope you can add calls and you can hear with headphones on.
1,"December 26, 2017"," Seemed like a good idea but it doesn't actually work.  My children cannot invite anyone (the app sends an email but the recipient can not do anything with it) to chat and I as a parent do not get notifications of who they invite.  So, the only people my children can chat with is me."
2,"January 10, 2018", I have to delete my childs account to change their avatar?  What the? Also I disabled Freddie on one account but there appears to be no way to enable it again.
3,"January 1, 2018"," Won't even open on my samsung S8 , keeps automatically shutting down saying monster messenger has stopped."
3,"January 10, 2018", We are using this with our kids but we want the trending stuff turned off. Is there a way to do that?
5,"January 13, 2018", This is a great way for my son to message his aunt. I love being able to safely send him messages too. It is great that I have to approve all his friends so he isn't talking to strangers.
5,"January 1, 2018", This is perfect for my 2 kids that are 6&8. Their dad and I share custody and with this on their tablets they can text either one of us when ever they want. It's Amazing!
5,"January 2, 2018", This is the perfect texting app for kids.  Since I have to approve anyone who can text my daughter before she can I feel very safe having her on there. She loves texting her friend and grandparents.
5,"January 19, 2018", Good for ensuring my children can communicate safely with family members without anyone else attempting to contact them without me knowing. I have to approve all contacts before they can speak to my children.
