To start, when they say ""ad free"", they mean it. It's ironic because Mood is one of the few apps that I actually want to pay for.   I like being able to customize colors (for each contact) and the additional options for notifications and and delivery status have set Mood a notch above most other SMS apps. I also like that they have a personal account that can sync my messages across devices.  I'm still waiting for Mood to add more customization options for vibration notifications, repeat notifications, and changing the color of different parts of the UI, but even without those, Mood is my favorite SMS app for sure."

5,"June 26, 2018"," Love this app its better than go sms pro I've always used the go sms pro 
but I so change my mind on that this is way better more customizable looks 
better just a great app all together"
5,"June 27, 2018"," After changing my notification sound. I still sometimes get the old 
notification sound instead of the current one. It does it randomly"
5,"July 8, 2018"," The only thing I wish it would do is save conversations when up upgrade 
your phone and reinstall the app"
5,"June 21, 2018"," So far so good. Wish the mic would stay visible all the time. Just had to 
switch to this from Samsung to get customizable notification tones for 
friends and family."
5,"July 19, 2018"," It's been my default SMS messenger for almost a year now. The only three 
options that surely are needed: The ability to archive messages, to 
copy/paste multiple messages and to copy/paste the entire chat."
5,"July 4, 2018"," I love this app. I wish you could video and edit pictures through it but I 
also would like to see how we could make the video we send in the message a 
bit better and faster. All in all this is the the app to have. # my all 
time favorite💯💯💯👍 💯💯💯"
2,"July 6, 2018"," Loved the app but now It gives me issues every time I try sending pictures 
even though the pictures are below the allowed MMS size limit."
3,"July 24, 2018"," There's a little problem. I don't receive some messages since 2 months. 
Don't know what wrong with the app"
5,"July 20, 2018"," I absolutely love how nearly every feature of this app allows for 
customization. Everything from backgrounds, colors and fonts can all be 
personalized! I've tried other SMS apps, but this one is the best."
5,"June 17, 2018", Best sms app. And I have used so many others so I know what I am saying
5,"June 27, 2018"," I purchased GoSMS and used it for a year then swapped back to the iPhone. I 
swapped back to the Sony xz2 and fell in love with mood"

feature is just so inconveniently laid out and is FAR from an easy 
experience... But I use the search constantly, so if it doesn't get 
streamlined, I'm gonna uninstall 👎 In response to yours: If you can add 
another option to filter search results? I'm specifically thinking ""most 
recent"" for my own personal uses. It's a massive hassle to scroll thru 
messages based on each contact, vs most recent. It would also be helpful to 
add a search icon next to the pencil icon rather than having to reach up 
for the menu drop down. (i have a note 8, and it's a strrrrech) Last but 
not least, when starting a new message, i love that the # keypad is easily 
reached, but how about adding the alphabet as well? I don't know contacts 
#'s, just the names. Or dropping the ""find contact"" bar would solve the 
problem too."
3,"June 27, 2018"," I want to love this app, but it is a much bigger drain on my battery than 
Textra or Messages. Please fix & I won't have to use those others!"
1,"July 5, 2018"," Cannot send picture messages while it works with any other app. For this 
reason alone, this app is useless."
5,"July 7, 2018"," Contact customizing was knocked out by Samsung Oreo so Mood saves the day 
unless customization is put back!"
5,"June 30, 2018"," The next stage in engaging texting interface. I'm really enjoying that you 
think out of the box. Thanks for a fantastic free product. I want to add 
that I would pay for a premium service with more futuristic themes."
4,"July 19, 2018"," Mood Msg does most everything I need, but was hoping the Mood icon would 
display the # of new mssg like it shows in the play store icon... I would 
give it 5 stars if it had that.."
5,"July 16, 2018"," Best message app I've found. Stock Google one kept crashing on me. This one 
doesn't. Cool."
5,"June 21, 2018"," The best text messaging app! I've used Messenger, Textra, hangouts, etc. 
and this one is by far the best! You can customize you bubbles, text, 
theme, etc. It suggests emojis based on words used. A+ 👌"
4,"July 23, 2018"," This app could easily be 5 stars for me but I cannot receive MMS over WiFi 
even though my carrier supports it. Please, please, please fix this!!!!"

checking message"
4,"June 27, 2018"," I absolutely love this app. But I'm noticing that my data is running thru 
quickly. Does this app use alot of data?"
5,"July 22, 2018"," Excellent App!! Can you guys add a feature to where you can reply or send 
an emoji for a specific message during group chat?"
5,"July 16, 2018"," I'VE USED THIS APP SINCE NOVEMBER 2017 AND LOVE IT! IT HAS OODLES OF 
FEATURES, AND IS BEAUTIFULLY DONE. I ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO CHECK IT OUT"
5,"July 9, 2018"," This has to be the best sms/mms app yet. Love the themes and the individual 
theme settings for each contact. Background, bubble style and color. Just a 
well thought out app. Love it. Galaxy S9+"
5,"June 17, 2018"," Thought I'd give it a try after reading so many good reviews. I wasn't 
disappointed very nice after showing it to my wife and son they both 
downloaded it as well and love it."
5,"June 22, 2018"," Its alot of fun, with all the different emoji's and the little gifs are 
funny and cute. I like how I can look up other stuff like restaurants and 
even skiing places to go."
5,"July 26, 2018"," Like the look of the app and haven't had any problems and no ads!! Please 
keep it that way"
2,"July 2, 2018"," I cant able to process your app. Its always loading. There is ""migration 
erro"" appear. Pls help."
4,"July 24, 2018"," Over all this is great, there are a few things that I would change. Like 
the ability to easily copy and paste a message. But the look, feel, and 
speed are all outstanding."
5,"June 20, 2018"," I've had this app for a couple of months now and I'm very pleased with it. 
I especially like how much I am able to personalize the background and 
sounds to fit each contact. The emojis are great!"
4,"July 8, 2018"," When did i change some setting regarding chat list or chat background 
capacity or some other app suddenly relaunch on my device (LG F16L) Can you 
check and fixed....."
4,"July 19, 2018"," So the icon continually displays a number 1, indicating that I have a 
message, but I don't. It's that normal or is there a way to correct that? 
Otherwise, great app!"
5,"June 21, 2018"," I love Mood, but i wish there were more options for themes.for instance, 
you have no rainbow themes. I really want a larger variety of theme 
options. Rainbow!"
1,"June 29, 2018", One problem occurred in new update confirmation tick mark does not show
5,"June 20, 2018"," Great app! Everything I've been looking for, this is life to my phone. I'd 
love more fonts but it's still a great app ❤ I can customize like almost 
everything! I love it."
5,"July 23, 2018"," Having come from Windows phone, this app was a welcome alternative to the 
stock Android text app. Very customizable with different colors and themes, 
so you can configure the appearance to your liking."
3,"June 22, 2018"," How do you stop receiving notices during your phone calls how do you stop 
receiving notices during your phone call"
5,"June 27, 2018"," Love it so far, switch from Textra for 2 yrs... We'll see. I would not like 
the animated emoji, way to turn that off? Wrote an email"
5,"July 23, 2018"," The only backlash with this app is it can't send videos, saying it is too 
long"
5,"July 20, 2018"," I love the way you can customize everything in this app. I love that I can 
pin my most frequent contacts to the top. Awesome, easy to use app"
4,"July 23, 2018", Surprisingly good! I love the fact that there aren't any annoying ads. 😊
5,"July 9, 2018"," Very good app but why isn't there an option to backup your messages in case 
you change phones or something else,,, other than that I love it"
4,"June 19, 2018"," I was very happy with app until recently. It will not download my group 
text. I am going to uninstall for a while to see if it gets better in a 
week or so."

will open it"

5,"July 1, 2018"," I just installed this app & so far it's GREAT & easy to use. I love the 
colors I can pick from to customize my theme on here too. No glitches for 
me either at this time."
5,"July 8, 2018"," First app I ever stopped what I was doing to rate. I love this app. It's 
one hundred times better than the other one I had."
5,"June 30, 2018"," I have tried quite a few SMS apps. This is the one that stays on my device! 
It's EXACTLY what I was looking for. And, it's FREE... But I would happily 
pay for it."
3,"July 12, 2018"," Lots of customization, options, features, and settings. I can make it what 
I want. Frequent updates and easy to use. However, incoming group messages 
are sent to me individually. Unfortunately, this is an absolute deal 
breaker for me."
3,"July 13, 2018"," If you could create a subject or multiple pics into a slideshow to send 
instead of 1 by 1, it would get 5 stars from me."
3,"July 21, 2018", I don't like that it automatically turns the screen off at 15 sec.
2,"June 23, 2018", MMS over wifi doesn't work most of the time. Have to move on
5,"July 19, 2018"," A wonderful app! You should definitely download to check out all it has to 
offer...Would rate 10 stars if I could. 🤗"
2,"June 29, 2018", It is so buggy is causes everything on my phone to go haywire.
5,"July 13, 2018"," I think it's good alternative to the usual messenger app! I like the emoji 
search as I text but I think it would be better to add the emoji after the 
word itself (or at least an option for that)"
2,"June 17, 2018"," Hate that I don't have the time the messages are received.. Like it 
frustrates me.."
2,"July 15, 2018"," I used to love this app, but recently it started messing up to where I was 
not receiving my messages. I ended up having to go back to using the 
default messaging app"

and change fonts. It's alot of fun if you don't like the same colors all 
the time."

me and if I could change the music for each individual person. But it's 
easy to use."
5,"July 10, 2018"," Honestly blew me away. The level of features and customizing is way above 
what I had expected."
5,"July 14, 2018"," I have no complaints. You can customize it and there are NO ads. Love the 
emojis and everything else. Did I mention there are no ads. This is one of 
the best apps in the Play Store."

needs, so far this is the best for me. thanks for this mood Messenger app."
5,"July 13, 2018"," Main reason I got this was because my new phone won't assign individual 
text sounds. The emoji movement is cool feature."
3,"July 11, 2018"," Overall good messenger app, lacking support for a few emojis, missing the 
ability to select skin color for emojis by default as well."

other party is typing. It says this app does that"

that I have on my phone all together in 1 place...."

answer your mails and if your suggestion is both useful and implementable, 
you can bet it would be there in one of the next updates. Can't ask for

you can more easily reply to a message from the new message popup ( a reply

sliding down from the notifications to write your reply or opening the chat

starting to enjoy this app much more than when I first downloaded it. It is

special. It is my go-to app for texting, still need to learn how to tweak 
this there are a few things that I can't seem to change but I'm sure the 
developer will get back to me quickly. Try this application I think you 
will like it. Developer quick to respond and working on a small issue that 
I have and I'm sure as always it will be resolved quickly. Great app must

But that isn't just this app, so in comparison its still one of the best."

apps. I still choose to use it, but that's the tradeoff."
