1,"April 8, 2018", Great app if you want to be spammed to death with pop-up ads. No one wants to see continous  interstitial ads pop up while they are corresponding with their contacts. I uninstalled the app after just a few minutes. Too bad..it would be a great app otherwise.

2,"March 31, 2018"," I downloaded app for its' auto reply feature. Everytime I turn it on, however, my phone starts vibrating as if I'm receiving hundreds of messages. I've left it on for 5 minutes and it still vibrates. Also, all memory on phone is being used."
2,"February 13, 2018", I used it for a total of 5 minutes before my phone was overwhelmed with pop-ups and ads. That's just not for me. Guess I'll stick to the free messaging that was on my phone
3,"February 16, 2018"," I am not able to send pictures? Every time I try I just get a msg that says ""cannot sent message now, too many unsent MMS messages."""
1,"April 20, 2018"," Pointless app without all wonderful themes. Unfortunately an avalanche of 
ads after installation of themes. Could not even see my own texts. Again 
fail! I am uninstalling. 😡😢😭"
2,"April 7, 2018"," Cannot see names in mms Msgs, cannot copy text to clipboard. Bought premium 
and it has signature for messages but little else. Sent Msgs to support, no 
response."
1,"April 13, 2018"," I do not want news feeds or advertising. I have the paid for version. I 
cannot turn off the top stories. it has an irritating pop up when finishing 
calls. Overall a disappointing experience."
1,"March 21, 2018", This App Is Stupid And Everyone Who Has It Should Delete Because It Does Not Let You Do Nothing!
2,"February 10, 2018", Only one sim msgs can be sent if in 1st sim msgs gets cmpltd then v cn use 2nd sim msgs but here it ud highly impossible
4,"February 7, 2018", I really like how you can change the theme and that I can combine all my messages in one...but there is too many add. I recently uninstalled the Facebook messenger for this messenger which I didn't get adds st all. So you get 4 stars for now.
3,"February 22, 2018"," Do you read your reviews? First being, how many reviews stated that they were deleting cuz of adds? Bad choice guy. If less adds equals continued customer and more choice to entice customer to pro then you still have that customer.

If less adds equals continued customer and more choice to entice customer to pro then you still have that customer. But you don't have that choice once they delete app. Its strange you want to make your money from add customers and not cuz of a quality product when you indeed have such. That's called greedy and not proud of your product. Don't be greedy and in time Your product will stand on its own with lots of customers and less adds. Number two issue is I have to stop to let the texting catch up. And I'm not even the fastest typer. Its very frustrating. If I'm excited or even angry and therefore passionate about what I'm texting to someone, I don't want to have to stop...wait...for...the...words...I...text...to...catch...up...get it? Number three, when I choose a theme, should it not over ride any background pic I formerly decided to choose? The theme pops up on the keyboard and the boarder of background wallpaper behind the messages but the pic I had chosen as my wallpaper prior to the theme remains. It looks choppy as they are nowhere close to being anything of the same topic. If I can't get this resolved I will not keep app as I'm all about the visuals. Last but not least, when I'm composing a msg, the keyboard stays on top of the msg. I cannot see what I'm typing. Why? I'm a terrible typed and must review what I'm composing. I shouldn't have to minimize the keyboard to do this. I have never had to do so until I added your app."
1,"March 12, 2018", I dont like getting l key board and in  order to get it i have to take messenger which i do want in my phone
5,"March 28, 2018"," I like this sms app, but wish there was a way you can see time, you do have time but some time after a few texts I like to see the time some on fb you can just down and it shows you the time of day but not with this sms messages. But I give you 5 stars 03/28/18"
3,"April 14, 2018"," It's OK but I hate these annoying ads... that's the only reason that will 
me to uninstall this app. How can I get rid of these ads??"
4,"February 20, 2018", Love it just haven't had time to figure it out yet all the way. I'm using a tablet and I'm hoping to use it like a text app because my tablet has service

The annoying ads each time I open the app to read or send a text is enough to offset any benefits. You can't apply a theme because instead of showing SMS themes, I'm forced to look at keyboard themes before I can install SMS themes. Honestly, it takes 3 times as long to send messages just be cause of the ads prior to opening g the application. Pathetic"
4,"February 8, 2018", Great for seeing everything together. BUT... I DON'T LIKE THAT IT ABSORBS EVERYTHING IN YOUR PHONE! And KEEPS! Might delete. There are too many data sniffers now!
3,"March 24, 2018"," I feel as tough my highly sensitive msg's, files, personalizations, & very valuable pics were highjacked without a simple 1-2-3 option of clearance before giving the right to ALL my info, inn fact my blackberry went into ""guest mode"" as if it were stolen...which is nothing new; so I choose to stop t...Full ReviewI feel as tough my highly sensitive msg's, files, personalizations, & very valuable pics were highjacked without a simple 1-2-3 option of clearance before giving the right to ALL my info, inn fact my blackberry went into ""guest mode"" as if it were stolen...which is nothing new; so I choose to stop the app. I do like where the options if u could choose them instead of once clicked on there's NO going back. Which makes this app scary when a trying to protect info, etc. Now I am stuck fixing your mess by re-arranging ALL, protecting All, maybe just getting All new device. What appealed to me at first: the screen lock that appears as fire that you're able to ""graphically zip up"" to hide where I left off. Don't get me wrong, but maybe start with simple apps, but have those ""EVERYTHING in ONE that takes over the default of a device (scary) to ones like me...still available for when I'd definitely be made ready for your app. Good work, just a little overwhelming as the first step. Keep up the color!!"
1,"April 2, 2018", Spent .99 cents & still doesn't work. Keep getting error messages aren't being sent. I've uninstalled & reinstalled & still get same error.
3,"April 6, 2018", I paid for the pro but none of the stickers are there or anything else very disappointing with thisapp.... is there someone to contact?
1,"February 8, 2018", Horrible ! paid for the pro and no picture messages come through and the annoying failed messages continues to display.
5,"March 9, 2018", I really like this app is better than SMS when I try to use SMS and I've used it for years now it messes up my phone does something to my phone so I appreciate this messaging yet appreciate this messaging app
5,"February 21, 2018"," Yes I like the new bring-your-own-device program to SafeLink and I went by Mom Android and yes I'm learning everything and if I don't get it right, let you know and that app"
1,"April 29, 2018"," Forces you to set it as your default SMS app before you can even see what 
it's like... shameful."
3,"January 26, 2018", Can do without the hoops to get into using the app..can also do without the inflated amount of apps
1,"April 21, 2018"," I am furious at having texts blocked and this app imposed on me. I do not 
want to use it."
5,"January 26, 2018", One of the best apps I've come across that doesn't have to many ads and works like it's supposed to unlike almost all the other apps I've downloaded that I get so frustrated with I uninstall it immediately
4,"April 28, 2018"," It is a little bit confusing at first, but if you have time to sit down and 
check out the different options for the app I believe that it's going to be 
easier to use as time goes on."
5,"April 28, 2018"," It is good for me to do a nove and you are not good i have got a lot of the 
time to get yellow of o f or something"
1,"March 6, 2018", I hate the adds and i keep bumping into it when im just trying to leave a msg. I hate it
4,"April 22, 2018"," The ""1"", on logo is misleading. App does not show unread / new messages"
5,"March 26, 2018", I like the way it pop up on my screen complimenting the gold Sony I use... My friends think is the normal app for my phone and they think my phone came with great features
5,"January 31, 2018", I like this app alot. the only thing missing us the suggested spelling of words.
3,"April 3, 2018", I went pro version I was wondering how do I stop the news texts stop flashing up

5,"January 31, 2018", I hear everything from the people that get to creeping and texting in water carwash . able to keep this and make you believe five star application
3,"March 20, 2018", I don't know about others but it freezes on my phone alot.
3,"January 25, 2018", A good app..  But a bit slow on my phone.
3,"March 21, 2018", Way to many adds pop up in the texting.  It's annoying
4,"April 22, 2018", I just added and I haven't had a chance to see what it's all about
3,"April 8, 2018", Shows 5 messages notification even when my box is empty.
5,"April 23, 2018", No matter how old you are this is a very easy app to use.
3,"March 21, 2018", I luv it but the only thing is is that.... u have to pay for the background and emojis♥
5,"March 3, 2018", A very nice app. You can change the background and have the keyboard to match it you can also do colors change the font and also change the color of the font user-friendly very nice thank you
