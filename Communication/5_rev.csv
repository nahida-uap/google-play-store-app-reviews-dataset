OTP is received, it intelligently detects it and ask whether to copy it. 
This feature blew my mind, as of now, no messaging app does that, and I 
loved it. The major feature(which personally I felt the absence) that I 
missed in this application is, ""user can't select multiple messages within 
a chat"", i.e., if there are some 20 messages(separate-separate) in a chat 
and if I want to delete messages present at 2nd, 5th, 8th, 16th, 17th 
position, I simply cannot. I think with an update you can bring in that 
feature, other than that, the application is very good. Overall excellent!"

It's got a beautiful design that lets you change the colors of each person's text bubbles, and now that there is a web app, I cannot be happier that I use this app. The web app works flawlessly, and is perfect for me since I can type way faster using a computer keyboard. Not only does the web app work flawlessly, but it's free, and has no ads. Sharing pictures is as easy as dragging and dropping files into the web app. I used to have an iPhone and Mac, and when I made the transition to a Pixel and PC, I missed being able to text from my computer. Don't have to worry about that anymore! And it's even better, because since it's a web app, I can easily text from any computer with an internet connection. 10/10."

pretty great."
5,"July 16, 2018", MUCH better now. Experienced a bug with loading images a while back. Love that there is a web app as well so I can send texts from my laptop when my phone is in the other room.
5,"June 22, 2018"," Love the app, have been using it on all my phone's for years. Very happy 
that they have now included Android Messages for Web, but it would be great 
to see this work on multiple devices, such as tablets, or even have it sync 
across more than one phone signed into the Google account."
1,"July 5, 2018"," Can't add contact as sms. No quick response available. Can't select and 
delete multiple text messages. Simply useless for SMS."
2,"July 9, 2018"," Things are getting better, but lacking customization. Plus, the app crashes 
on me at least twice a week or more."

4,"July 14, 2018"," One complaint so far and it's a big one... Text messages have a size limit 
and some attachments trigger an error message"
3,"July 18, 2018"," Need multiple read of messages option. Get inspired from small apps like 
Kyte.AI when it comes to filtering spam and sorting messages. Am a lover of 
Google products, but not this messages !! Work something better please."
5,"July 15, 2018", The best. Swipe can be squirrelly and funny but I couldn't live without it!
4,"June 27, 2018"," The app runs smoothly without any glitches. However, it would be really 
helpful if one can directly access Contacts and share the contact details 
as sms. Now to share contact details you'll have to go to contacts and 
there we can share it only as mms. Can you do something about it?"

through every step they said to go through if an app isn't working and have 
only received a non-reply email giving me a link to the help page. Honestly 
don't know what to do anymore but the app is almost unusable at this point. 
Not sure if it's just a Google pixel thing but this has been my experience."

down my throat through Facebook messages. That was until I switched from 
iOS to Android and found that the native messaging application was 
extremely limited. My messages take 5-10 min to show up which becomes 
especially frustrating when you're waiting on a temporary sign-in key. I'm 
sure my carrier has something to do with my speed of service but a ""chat"" 
function usually relies on cell data or wifi (which I'm on 90% of my life). 
I don't see this as an option with Android messages. I tried out the 
desktop sync and it's just a mirror of the phone app. Messenger isn't a 
perfect substitute either because it is too easy to get Facebook originated 
messages confused with your SMS and your notifications become useless. 
These are the options I have for default messaging on my Motorola G5. I've 
tried using other apps that aren't set to default but its not possible to 
completely ditch a native text app. Especially when your real phone number 
tied to a known device is required for verification purposes. Im tired of 
trying to explain Google voice to my mother and most other messaging apps 
require that the recipient also use the application. I think enabling a 
chat function would grow back a couple of stars."
1,"July 4, 2018"," Really not a fan of the notification sticking after quick reply. The point 
of notifications is to notify. Using quick reply acknowledges that I'm 
notified, and should dismiss the notification. If I want a whole 
conversation I'll open the app. There really should be a toggle to turn 
this off."
4,"July 11, 2018"," The app is progressing well and it is almost at the level of Textra. Please 
add a way to save MMS attachments to a specific location. Also, please 
consider an auto clean up (keep at most x SMS and y MMS) globally and also 
per user. Thanks!"
5,"July 18, 2018"," This is a very good texting app and I like how you can get quick replies 
where there is three answers to texts you receive that are normally yes no 
and maybe's but can also be "" we're here, we're on our way, and almost 
there"" I recommend this a lot!"
1,"July 20, 2018"," Have been using this app for more than a year now and loved it until they 
rolled out their ""use data or wifi chat"" feature. I have already disabled 
chat features but my SMS doesn't get received until I turn on my data/wifi.
