One must access the cell and scan the QR code again for access via one's

not need to do so unless my cell has been reported lost or stolen. There 
have been times I have left my cell at home but I have my tablet in hand. 
It would be nice if I could maintain my connection through this app without 
needing my cell to be close by and turned on. Thank you for your time and 
consideration."

My tablet is 'compatible with this version' of Whatsapp so I decided to see if I can get an app that downloads it for you. I thought that maybe I should try this out and I never knew it was this easy to use! It connected really fast to my Whatsapp and I was just amazed! Thanks for this app! I'm grateful for it and you definitely deserve the 5 stars!
1,"May 25, 2018"," When i open tablet messenger.... Automatically chrome has been opened...and 
this issue is started from today... Plz resolve the issue....becoz 
yesterday when i opened it.. Drctly the messaged page had arrived.. Thr was 
no Any problem"
5,"May 4, 2018"," This is a very handy app that enables me to use WhatsApp on my tablet. It's 
very easy to connect to the phone. It doesn't seem to have any bugs or 
glitches. It's a thumbs up from me!"
3,"May 27, 2018"," This was good for a few days but it seems like it's not fully compatible 
and is now just opening the WhatsApp page. I hope someone makes an app that 
will work reliable Across both phone and tablet."
3,"April 13, 2018"," Great app so far. Would have been 5 stars but for the date being incorrect, new created and new incoming are 1hr behind the system date which is set correct GMT+1, BST summer time. All other apps work fine."
4,"April 21, 2018"," App had some issues from start compared to previous app, but its getting 
better and has some nice functions now like background messages and just 
being able to close the app by double tapping return button"
2,"April 29, 2018"," Bad. I tried to search a gif and it went to emojis. Can't change my 
background to a pic I want, I can only change it to diff colors. My 
contacts are on the right and because of that, it makes it harder to text. 
Can you PLEASE make it like regular WhatsApp, or am I just being dumb xD"
1,"May 26, 2018"," I get directed to a useless website ..... rubbish app. Perhaps I should 
give more details but looking at other comments this is a wider issue than 
just my problem."
5,"May 20, 2018"," I'm very impressed so far. It has performed as promised. I am now able to 
chat via whatsapp on my tablet. I will update my review after I have been 
using it long enough to really be able to review its performance over time."
5,"May 28, 2018"," I never thought it would be so easy to connect, if you want WhatsApp on 
your tablet or iPad I definetly say you should get this one!!!üòúüòÅ"
4,"April 6, 2018", The only thing I can fault it on is it often disconnects so you have to re scan the bar code
1,"May 27, 2018"," It is almost useless. It doesn't have voice and video calling features. 
Even typing is not that friendly. I don't believe the developer can't add 
these features."
5,"May 24, 2018"," Absolutely love this app, it's a life saver for not being able to use 
WhatsApp on my tablet, just hope this app isn't some scam that steals 
people data, cough cough Facebook ü§óüòÇ"
3,"May 1, 2018"," I have an iphone 6 and here it states that this app may not be optimized 
for this device. Don't know what to expect from that"
5,"April 6, 2018", I love this app keeps private just great can call people in spain and talk to them using video calling with no high price phone bill. Love the script to keep private.
5,"April 6, 2018"," Works well on my tablet despite saying that is possibly wouldn't, so very happy"
5,"April 21, 2018"," After Disa's WhatsApp plugin support has ended, this is the best way to use 
your WhatsApp account on a secondary device (e.g: tablet) keeping it active 
on your phone."
3,"May 10, 2018"," Seems okay what's app on my phone is great still getting used to tablet 
messenger"
5,"May 25, 2018"," When I open and close the app, I can't see the messages which have been 
sent to me lol üòéüòéüëçüëçüÜíüÜíüéÆüéÆ"
3,"April 30, 2018"," The voice notes doesn't work. Plus this app needs an update to facilitate 
voice and video calls"
4,"May 14, 2018"," Even though this app may not be optimized on an ASUS tablet, it works 
really with WhatsApp.apk on the tablet."
3,"April 22, 2018"," I have problem . I have scan WhatsApp today but not reachable why ? No 
connected"
5,"April 4, 2018", Unsure haven't tried it yet. Easy to load though.‚ò∫
5,"April 23, 2018"," Works well, could never understand why this wasn't part of the main app, as 
with Telegram"
5,"May 7, 2018"," Set up, via barcode scanner in WhatsApp works perfectly. Contacts and 
conversations imported instantly. Looking good so far! Well done to the 
development team."
1,"May 25, 2018"," It's not working ! When you try to use it just goes to the WhatsApp website 
. Until today it was a great App. It's a pity"
5,"May 25, 2018"," I have been very pleased with WhatsApp messenger so when I got a tablet I 
wanted to try it there. Tablet messenger made it easy to sync. Very slick! 
I am pleased!"
5,"April 25, 2018"," Wow I was trying download others WhatsApp for my tablet and no good at all 
but this works perfectly"
5,"April 19, 2018", A little slow when I first download it
1,"April 29, 2018", Wouldn't work on my lenovo tablet.
5,"April 17, 2018"," The best of the bunch. Enter key adds a line rather than sending, a big 
deal for those of us used to that function."
5,"April 30, 2018"," It works well and does what it says without all of the issues you sometimes 
get with other apps"
5,"April 26, 2018"," I've been wanting to use WhatsApp on my tablet for a while and this app 
works great. Was very easy to set up."
5,"May 12, 2018"," Brilliant ap. I've just started using it and have already recommended it to 
my family. Hope it continues to be trouble free!"
5,"May 25, 2018", App stopped work....send to whatsapp website
5,"April 27, 2018"," Works great on my tablet. And so much easier to use than on a little mobile 
screen and keyboard. Fairly customisable"
5,"May 11, 2018"," Hooray! Now I can send text messages from my tablet while using WhatsApp on 
my phone."
5,"May 25, 2018", One of the best thing that they have came up with. Love it!!
5,"April 12, 2018"," It was very easy to link my contacts. Wish it had video chat that would 
have made it perfect on the tablet"
4,"May 15, 2018", Took several tries to get it right
5,"May 25, 2018"," I like this app more than the other social apps, I wish it had better emojis"
2,"May 28, 2018"," Worked fine for a week but just like everyone else is reporting it just 
takes you to the what's app page."
4,"May 26, 2018"," Very good, resolution good, easy to use, BUT videos don't play on my Time2 
tablet(Android 5.1)"
5,"May 7, 2018"," I use the app on my phone and it was great and so easy to set the app on my 
tablet . Now I have the benefit of both. üòä"
1,"May 27, 2018"," Not solved yet redirected to whats site. and application shows blank not

with friends and family."

5,"March 19, 2018", Great app every one should have it on there tablet
5,"March 19, 2018", It's a nice app .....recommend for  everyone to install
5,"March 17, 2018", A good app
5,"March 22, 2018", Love it.need to improve little
5,"March 19, 2018", Great app
1,"March 17, 2018"," Buggy, flakey, crashes and not improving at all. Why such a backward step from WhatsTablet has been taken I simply cannot fathom."
4,"March 16, 2018"," Great app. Much more responsive that the previous app and seems to holds the connection better. The only issue I have is that it seems to be missing from the ""Share"" menu which makes it rather difficult to send videos, links, files, etc. If you add that, I'll give it a well deserved 5 stars :)"
4,"March 18, 2018", Good app but needs to pop up in the android share menu to make easy to share pictures and videos. So if I am in my picture gallery and hit share via I want his app to be in the list of apps available in the share app list.
4,"April 2, 2018"," I really like the app, but I wish there was an option to block its sounds (kind of like you can do in a browser, where not even videos or audio messages are played with audio), because when a notification arrives while I'm listening to music, it interrupts the music.

It could just be an item at settings or something like that."
5,"March 28, 2018", Best WhatsApp for tablet I have found shame actual WhatsApp can't sort out an app for this but hey. Easy to set up and use.
3,"April 2, 2018"," You can't use it by itself alone,  needs to have the phone with whatsapp open, connected to internet and very near. Not very practical as you always need to go with the two devices together.  So it's not any better than using whatsapp web on the device"

It is very helpful especially when you are recording audio messages to many contacts that you can't view on your phone while your recording is going on. This allows you to mention their names together especially when dedicating songs to many people.
5,"April 6, 2018", I purchased WhatsTablet only to get the message that it's to be shut down amd I should purchase this one which has ads. Why shut down something that people paid for? Will I get a refund?
5,"March 22, 2018"," Having had WhatsApp on my phone, I wanted to still be able to use it if my phone was on charge. Turns out to be even more useful than that. I din't have to keep switching between my tablet and phone if I want to message any if my contacts. Very convenient."
3,"March 23, 2018", Haven't used it much but the rating page comes up every time the app is opened from the first time of use
2,"March 16, 2018", Rubbish all I get is notification of the new music app. Can no longer get back to any messages.
3,"April 1, 2018"," Unlike the phone app, the Tablet version seems to always take much longer to start running"
4,"March 24, 2018", Pretty good still missing some key features  and doesn't get time stamps right but other then that a great alternative for whatsapp
5,"March 25, 2018"," I like it; it's more stable than WhatTablet was, staying on without having to have my mobile re-read a QR code."
5,"March 27, 2018"," It's very handy to have WhatsApp on your tablet, particular for sharing things like Screen Shots"
5,"March 12, 2018", My other app for WhatsApp Tablet disappeared so I we pleased to find this and it was quick and easy to install and sync

5,"March 4, 2018"," A very useful complement to WhatsApp for mobile phones. So far the only issue I've seen is that my mobile phone WhatsApp tells me that there's an active connection to a ""Windows 7"" computer ;-) Why not call it ""Tablet Messenger""?"
5,"March 6, 2018", So far so brilliant! Now that I have this app on my tablet my phone is going to be almost defunct
4,"March 9, 2018"," I don't know if it's possible, but I would love to see this app fit all contents in one screen without having to scroll horizontally."

5,"March 9, 2018", Great to be able to contact family and friends on my tablet as well as the phone. Easy to connect and easy to stay in touch.
4,"March 5, 2018"," It is good so far,  however, missing video and phone calls with the App."
5,"March 9, 2018", I have just downloaded it but I am really happy so far- it's exactly what I was looking for :) ticks all the boxes

3,"February 12, 2018", Keyboard access disappears spontaneously just like the last version. Allows copy and paste but no amount of tapping will bring up keyboard - makes its redundant really.
4,"February 10, 2018", Can't use the keyboard now. It's useless if you can't type a message. This just happened. It was a very useful app before. Now it's not that useful. Please fix this issue.

The old app did that fairly well.  This app does NOT."
3,"February 18, 2018"," So far, it seems okay. I wish there's a way to easily 'share' things to someone with this like you would on WhatsApp. Atm, the app doesn't come up as an option to share something like a webpage or article on other apps."
