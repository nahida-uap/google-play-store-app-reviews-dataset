I have no idea why this is happening but it happens to both my phones which are on different service providers. I since downloaded a different SMS app with loads of free background themes including animated ones and it works perfectly and there are no adds so far. If this developer can fix this annoying problem and offer more free themes and less adds then I will re-install it and use it as it does have a lot of great themes.
