But stickers don't show just a big white box. Try to share something from the internet but it only shows the link to the site but not what I try to​ share. The biggest issue is the HUGE ad across the bottom. It covers the last of the messages and if I try to comment it covers so I can't post.
1,"August 17, 2017", I want to access instagram using this app but it is not working properly ...😣😣😣 it's very annoying and irritating!!!! my friends don't install this app....... it is just a waste of time and thank you for reading my review 😀😁
1,"November 29, 2017"," Used this a while back and it was useful. Reinstalled today and I get an error that this app is still in development and I haven't got access to it. I'd assume a blip, but reviewers are saying the same since at least a week ago."
2,"November 30, 2017", I am being logged out constantly by this app. Please fix that. Constantly having to log in again is getting on my nerve.
2,"March 6, 2017", The app setup is awesome and exactly what I've been wanting until I tried to comment on a post that is. Do something about the ads covering the reply textbox and your app will be the best on the market.
