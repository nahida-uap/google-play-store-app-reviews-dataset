message.any person whose phone number I had ever saved. I had assumed it 
would only allow him to contact those I had chosen. But that was not the 
case. I can not risk him messaging his principal or anyone else not 
approve...Full ReviewI liked the idea but when my son when to use it, it gave him free range to 
message.any person whose phone number I had ever saved. I had assumed it 
would only allow him to contact those I had chosen. But that was not the 
case. I can not risk him messaging his principal or anyone else not 
approved one day on a whim. So I had to delete it. Great idea bad execution."
3,"May 28, 2018"," I think this is a good app, my son loves it. I think it would be better if 
the sound were louder, it's hard to hear the person that you are talking 
to. Also I'm not sure why but this app just vanished off of my son's device 
as if he had uninstalled it, when he didn't."
3,"May 28, 2018"," It's lame that my son can send gifs but when I'm on my phone talking to him 
I can't. That's the fun part of messenger. Basically he has all the fun 
stuff of regular messenger but the people that chat with him don't."
2,"May 24, 2018"," To many pop up ads literally every minute for kids. Just bait for kids some 
ads are not even age appropriate. Get rid of the ads"

and stop bugging me."
4,"May 26, 2018"," Needs update. When my daughter sends the stickers where hearts float up she 
wonders why it doesnt send hearts up on hers."

allow call option without video."

5,"May 15, 2018"," Works great! Create a child account on you main Facebook account, and then 
just install this on your child's device and sign in. Then approve or 
reject contacts they find on their device with your device, and it's all 
set. Easy."
3,"May 12, 2018"," I think the app is ok but its needs fixing. I can't add any new contacts. 
The only contact my daughter has are the ones I added before the app was 
ready to use. she continuously sends me request and to no avail I can't 
approve any of them. It's says find contact and then nothing..."
