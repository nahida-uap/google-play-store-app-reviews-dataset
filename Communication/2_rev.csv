like that anyway :-) I still want the font size in the ""comment"" input 
window/field to be bigger, but I think I might have just found how to do 
that. Also I would like the home screen [?] to default to the notifications 
list; it defaults to the messages history at the mo. And I use the Google 
handwriting input app which works with this 'Lite' app, but the input 
capture speed and accuracy both seem a bit reduced compared to some other 
apps. Of course being forced to write slower and do more like print than 
cursive, is probaby theraputic in my case so 5 stars is righteous."

It even has the best and loudest in-app video player I've seen in these kinds of app. That said, notifications are a bit delayed, which is why I always miss calls. I also still can't share links, photos, or videos from my newsfeed to labeled group chats. I'd have to tag each member one by one and even then, my post would still show up on a duplicate thread with our names as the default label instead of appearing on the already existing thread with the customized group name. Also, I wanna use night mode but it doesn't look too good in my opinion because of the design and colors used. Some stuff aren't even clearly visible. The notification light blinks too fast and too long in its current configuration as well. Lastly, I hope you make it faster and easier to switch accounts from the left side drawer, make it possible to more conveniently download photos in chat just by long-pressing the thumbnails instead of opening them one by one, and make a way for us to be able to download videos, especially from chat threads, not just the newsfeed. UPDATE: Working links/attachments posted by other people on chat threads don't appear anymore. I'm sure it's not because the links are dead or the attachments are unavailable/taken down already as I can see and open them just fine on Messenger Lite. That said, I checked the Facebook desktop site/view on my mobile browser (Chrome app) and I don't see the links/attachments either, while Facebook's mobile view on said browser doesn't let us view messages at all, as usual and forces us to install the app or switch to the desktop site. By the way, sometimes the bottom advertisements block the option/button to see all notifications. Closing them doesn't even work because that just replaces them with other targeted advertising."

Have tried clearing cache, data, uninstalling, re-installing, restarting the phone and such, but no, it just hangs. No intermediate app-update, just stopped working. Am I the only one? All I get is a white screen and then nothing. Thought at first that it's an internet connectivity issue, found out when out and about, but same on mobile network, as well as on stable and rock solid WiFi at home.  Answer: Everything else works, web browsers, and official FB messenger app works, on my phone, can't say more than that. Everything else works on the app as well, just the loading of messages that don't. Currently using an old Samsung phone.  EDIT: If I go to ""Online Friends"", I can click on any of them, and from there I can access and use messages, specifically for that user, still not when clicking the general ""Messages"" however, that hangs as before."

The only things I wish you would add is the ability to upload more than one photo FROM my phone's gallery to Facebook, and to upload them directly to FB albums. This app only gives the option of uploading one photo to my wall or in a message.  Because of this flaw I must keep another app just for that purpose. Also, can't save/download photos. Update -12/10/17- I am still using the Metal app to upload multiple photos to my wall and directly to FB albums. It also uses less space than this ""lite"" app. You said I can upload more than one photo to Facebook FROM my phone's gallery, but this app does not show that option. When trying,  the only options are ""Wall"" or ""Message."" How do I do it? I now see I can save/download photos from FB, but it requires opening the photo in another window. That's 3 steps to save.

5,"December 29, 2017", Update:  the app has been so glitchy since updating it.  I still like it though because it doesn't hog space like the official app  Facebook Messenger is a space hog and greedy on permissions so I don't use it.   I'm thankful for this little gem!
3,"December 19, 2017"," This app had been working great, but while better than the actual FB, I am now having issues. The 3 dots to get to edit takes me to a pull down menu, and trying to see who likes/loves takes me to friend requests."

Finally, it must be updated in a competitive way and it will win as an application if they do it as a small application that does not consume memory space."
3,"December 28, 2017", I would love this app. But banner ads over the text box? Tricking you into clicking. I really really do not appreciate that.
3,"December 31, 2017"," Great app in some respects, less bloated, more privacy and combined messenger and Facebook but there are glitches, can't press on certain things toward the top of the screen as they take you to the wrong places. I will happily rewrite this once those issues are sorted..."
4,"January 3, 2018", Does Facebook really well. Small install. Started having issues freezing.
4,"December 14, 2017", Good but a bit clunky sometimes. Nowhere near as bloated as the FB app though so the occasional quirks are forgiveable.
5,"January 5, 2018", I love this app so far... It's the way fb should be. There is no reason to have fb and messenger separated...so fkn stupid and annoying
5,"December 24, 2017", Pleased to be back after a break when i bought this a while ago. Bugs that bothered me have been fixed and this is back to being my main Facebook app
5,"January 28, 2018", I love this app. It's very reliable and easy to use.  Also i like the fact that you can download videos and save pictures. Also video takes a very short time to load which makes it better
3,"January 8, 2018"," Like that it doesn't take up too much space. I can make outgoing video and phone calls, but I can't receive them."
5,"January 14, 2018", Has turned out to be a very good app. Has issues on occasion like any other but is all in all much better than the alternative by far. Good work and thank you.
2,"December 12, 2017", the app needs Improvement the app needs Improvement it keeps freezing up every time I try to upload a photo to my page it will not let me do it it's a sometime it will and sometime it won't fix that and you have a perfect appo
5,"December 21, 2017", So far this app is just like the Facebook for you app just less megabytes you can call you can text you can post everything that Facebook does you can do on this app even video calls
4,"December 18, 2017", The app takes a fairly long to refresh your messenger chat; alot faster to pull down the screen and refresh it yourself but it is annoying and something that I and most users aren't used to as it is usually refreshed every sec automatically.
5,"December 27, 2017", Love this app way better than the facebook one keep up the good work 10 stars from me :D
4,"December 14, 2017", I like this app because it works on my Android. Had problems with messenger.
5,"December 9, 2017", I can't call anyone but besides that I love Love love this app

1,"February 26, 2018", Garbage. It works like a poorly greased chariot. Thanks for trying.
5,"December 24, 2017", Is there a way to download videos people send in messenger? I'm not finding that option but thought it was there before.
4,"December 7, 2017", Why does it need permission to change system settings to enter the settings page of the app? Why the need for that permission in the first place?
5,"January 4, 2018"," the app. is fast, I love it, but then, there's no video call/group call, etc. features, hope you can update, thank you!"
4,"December 14, 2017"," I don't use Facebook to upload anything, so this lite version gives me what I want. It's fast."
5,"January 7, 2018"," It takes less space and is still very similar to the original. In some ways,I think it's better."
5,"January 1, 2018"," Great app, not perfect tho', but still much better than the official!"
5,"December 24, 2017"," Great app but having paid for, thought would be add free. Fix this then 5* As fixed, now 5*"

I paid to remove ads. It's worth the price.  I like that I can configure it in ways the FB app can't. I got this mainly to allow me to use FB feed and Messenger messages in a single, clean, lightweight app that doesn't require me to restart my phone like Messenger did when I closed it.    Technically I could have left Messenger running before, but everything I did would crawl at a snail's pace (including typing) until I restarted my phone.  This app allows me to uninstall Messenger and still send/receive messages without issue now, with the added benefit of also browsing FB feed in the same GUI."
5,"November 20, 2017"," Had a problem with videos after the last update. Dev responded very quickly and advised how to resolve it. Normal service now resumed with this excellent app. I'd never use the native FB app in a million years, this app does everything required in a small, efficient package. Highly recommended."
3,"November 19, 2017", It's better than the beast that is the official FB App.  Apparently while using this app my Google Pixel is now a Lenovo Vibe S1 when Facebook sends me login notification emails. UPDATE: videos seem to auto play now where they didn't before. Cannot find a setting to turn this back off.
2,"November 22, 2017"," Was working great, now all of a sudden I cannot few my messages. Tried both new and old formats, when I open the message section, all i see is white screen with a tiny grey square up at the top. Please fix or give me an idea how I can fix myself."
5,"December 1, 2017"," This is one of the best facebook app alternative.  After I changed my phone to blackberry keyone with 3gb ram, the normal Facebook app was no go for me. This perfectly and entirely replace that app."
5,"November 30, 2017", This app is both faster and more basic and to the point than regular messenger and its cool you have regular facebook along with messages. It is nice that its faster cuz I have a slow cheap android phone

I mulled over this particular app, and a webpage shortcut, messenger lite combo. This is the clear winner. And I feel.i got some sense of security back.

4,"October 5, 2017", Scrolling bugged? Keeps scrolling up when I try to swipe downward.
4,"October 4, 2017", Uploading images and files in chats doesn't work anymore.
2,"October 7, 2017", Since my review was deleted here is anther one.DOWNLOAD and viewing images SUCKS on this app.

It's because it means it is a lightweight app. How much lighter? Messenger and Facebook combined is about 900mb, so let's round up to 1gb. Then, you have to take into account how ridiculous Facebook and messenger drain the battery and memory. This app starts at 20mb, and I'm currently at 69mb (storage increases as images, chat logs, etc. Go up. Aka cache.)  So, I highly recommend this app, this savior of our current decade while Facebook still exists."

Other than that, the app is okay if they stop adding suggestions and recommendations."
4,"September 8, 2017"," The jury is still oot. So fair, so gud!  Update: Fix the problem with loading .gif files!! Also a few glitches, comments when posting from outside of Facebook don't show up!! Still better than bowing down to the Facebook corporation and installing their junk on my phone."
1,"November 7, 2017"," This app is a load of garbage. Every time I try to type a long post, and scroll down, it takes me to the page where I make a post and completely erases everything I type. Then the ads at the bottom occasionally cover the bottom part of the text field above the keyboard and I cannot see what I type."
4,"September 15, 2017"," The apps great, way less permissions and doesn't take up all your ram and possessing power 24/7. I'm having trouble tagging people, but editing the post seems to work every time. I'd like to see that fixed but besides that A1 app"

Still beats having to go to my laptop just to read messages. Thanks :)"
5,"September 28, 2017", Works like says uses far less battery and memory and I dislike face book but need it to talk to sister in another state so it's perfect for me! Awesomeness

But this app does seems to access FB via the mobile site (which most do) which has problems with not being able to reliably turn off notifications for posts that you reply to.  I uninstalled the FB app when I saw I could turn notifications off on a post, but just noticed that the drop down on a post I want to silence only to see the option to turn notifications ON, rather than Off. I have noticed the drop down only works reliably on the desktop site.  I wonder what sort of down side there would be to simply pull from the regular desktop site, since I think FB not fixing the mobile site is one way they try to drive people to their app."
5,"September 17, 2017"," Love it. Besides the logout thing, this is perfect. Doesn't take up a lot of room. Talking about the logout thing its cool no one can use my phone for Facebook unless they exit twice. So sweet thanks!"
1,"September 8, 2017"," Phone kept playing random guitar and drum noises. Spent hours tracking down various video autoplay options, but still the same damn bass guitar and drums. Had to uninstall it."
5,"September 30, 2017", Love it everything Facebook with no glitches ram eating constant updates or nonsense the ads aren't intrusive either. Used it for a while now and never had issues unlike with the genuine Facebook apps
2,"September 15, 2017"," Uninstalling because... ""Add friends to see more stories"". The app stops you browsing your need feed until you hit 'Find friends now' button. The ads are bad enough but understand they pay the bills but what's the forced friend finding about?"
5,"September 20, 2017"," So far this is just as good, if not better then the actual facebook app itself. And soooo much smaller then the original app. Cant see myself switching back...."
1,"December 3, 2017"," It lets you not install Facebook messenger, but is buggy. Undismissable ads ruin videos, I get notifications when I send chat messages, and when I'm actively in the app. Ads taking away functionality feels like a forced upgrade and was the last straw. I was about to upgrade too. On to the next one."
5,"September 18, 2017"," So much better than the FB app; barely any permissions, but performs just as good if not better than the real thing... Highly recommended..."

5,"September 6, 2017", I like this app as it doesnt use much memory.   But the latest update doesnt bring up my 'show first favorites' and I need to go back to the real facebook app to see these items with ease.
1,"September 13, 2017", Had to uninstall because it keeps playing the same guitar music on loop even when the app is in the background  but the second I kill the processes it stops very frustrating
4,"September 16, 2017"," Works ok and is light on drive space, but lacks in a lot of features the actual Facebook messenger has. The advertisements cover up the emojis! And that is highly annoying and should be fixed and or just remove all ads all together. Any ad is a bad ad no one likes advertisements!!!"
1,"September 18, 2017", AVOID. tried as suggested by developers. Now it's locked on my phone and won't unistall but it removed the original fb app using the unistall from them in the store. Wow what a buggy program.....now I get to try and clean up this mess

3,"September 27, 2017", Only thing I didn't like was being asked multiple times to rate the app before I have a chance to use it and give fair review
5,"September 24, 2017"," I love it! Better than the regular facebook asking permission for everything before app is downloaded.  Easy and very simple to use! The Best app √©ver! Recommending to everyone I know... Plz no changes in the future, Thank u!"
3,"September 11, 2017"," It's OK. Some bugs in group chat uploading. Very slow to refresh, needs more live. I know it will get better"
5,"September 30, 2017"," So far great app. Used not much battery at all. Love how messenger is part of it and still has photos, emojis, etc.    Haven't looked in depth yet - but so far so good."
5,"September 30, 2017", Love this app. Just a few bugs which I have reported but all in all much better than the official apps.
1,"September 21, 2017", Add that popmover your text when typing somyou can't see what you are typing.  Brilliant implementation.  Bunch of ass.
3,"September 7, 2017"," Still a pretty good app, but it's still difficult to turn off post notifications whenever you're tagged in a post and someone likes or comments on it!"

4,"September 7, 2017", would get 5 from me if it could block the people you may know part.
3,"September 6, 2017", Kind of disappointed because I can't tag my friends.

1,"September 15, 2017"," Update and stops working , really bro?"
4,"September 20, 2017"," I needed a way to easily manage two profiles, so adding this app in conjunction with the regular FB app is working great!"

5,"September 29, 2017", Yep! WAY FASTER AND SMALLER IN APP SIZE COMPARED TO FACEBOOKS OWN... DATA HOG

3,"September 30, 2017", It's working for me so far.
4,"September 15, 2017"," Not exactly snappy, but gets it done."
3,"September 19, 2017", Can not receive call
5,"September 24, 2017", So far I like it
5,"September 8, 2017"," It works as a lightweight and fully-fledged feature app, for me."

4,"September 1, 2017"," Takes up significantly less space than the official F'book app, but works just like it."
3,"September 1, 2017", App update constantly sends me notifications of messages I have despite having it disabled. I have messenger installed and don't need double notifications whenever I receive a message
3,"September 1, 2017"," Does what it's supposed to, but the messenger portion is clumsy."
5,"August 31, 2017", Honestly this app is better than fb original... Developers of the fb app need to take a step back..üòÇüòÇ

5,"August 19, 2017"," This app is amazing. No more stupid messenger notifications and my day junk. And saving storage space is also a great bonus. Sure I can't video call or send gifs anymore, but that's a small price to pay for a phenomenal app! Keep it up developers!"

3,"August 10, 2017", Like this app as it is a lot smaller than the original but it won't let me check-in It says I have to turn on my location first but it is on so have to use another app to check-in which is annoying .I emailed the developer but got no reply.
5,"August 26, 2017", I love this version of messenger.  For some reason I can't install Facebook messenger anymore. It will download but after 15 minutes or more of waiting for it to install I gave up.
1,"August 11, 2017", Dude seriously could you make this damn app any more complicated??? I'm forced to login every single time and there's no one click option. Then it says something about have to close twice before logging back in. What the hell do you even mean by clothes twice??? Uninstalling!!!!!!!
4,"August 5, 2017"," Way better than the actual FB app. I don't need two apps for everything and I have room left over on my phone. So what are the ads when you get them with the actual app, just in a different way"
5,"August 6, 2017"," Excellent app that is light weight and non invasive compared to the full blown full facebook app, And still pretty much fully functional. I can view facebook & message people and send stickers and what ever."

5,"July 30, 2017", Badass freed up 1 gb worth of space.. Got rid of both Facebook and messenger huge need for data. A+ App
5,"August 27, 2017"," It does what it says and works fine. A lot lighter, faster, and smoother than Facebook's own behemoth data gobbler. Ads are down at the bottom and don't get in the way."
5,"August 26, 2017"," Only just reinstalled this, glad to see the payment op is now working to get rid of the adverts.  Very good takes up less room on your phone  Recommended"
3,"August 21, 2017", My GBoard is still dropping and won't go back up unless I tap multiple times. Otherwise I love it. Great replacement for Messenger.
3,"August 11, 2017", Won't let me send a photo. I have tried several times and it just will not send.
5,"August 20, 2017", Lighter on the battery and better than Facebook ... and slightly quicker to notify - still got both whilst I test it - and with an inbuilt messenger. What more can I ask.
4,"August 20, 2017"," After a recent factory reset of my phone,  the official Facebook and messenger app wouldn't work at all so this has been a godsend.  Thank you."
5,"August 4, 2017", after sharing/writing a post please let us resume browsing on the feed instead of returning to the top... aka resetting the feed
5,"August 1, 2017", I was having problems with the fb app and now I don't with this wonderful app.
5,"August 1, 2017", Bhout acha app hai messenger download karne nhi padega aur v Facebook lite surf isko kar lo.
5,"August 26, 2017", so much better than the bloated FB app with its seperate messenger app you are forced to install
5,"August 3, 2017", It's really lite. Fully featured. It does drain battery a tad bit in the background. But overall it's swell
5,"August 22, 2017", Best app ever my phone has little to no storage space with this app I can now run updates
2,"August 13, 2017", After the app updated it started crashing when I open it and I reinstalled it too but it didn't help.
3,"August 21, 2017"," When default is set to ""open to newsfeed"", and the default newsfeed is set to ""top stories"", it still opens as ""most recent"" instead. Please fix for 5 stars."

5,"August 14, 2017", Facebook messenger and social posting app for around 40 MB instead of 600 MB. Yeah this app much better than the official one.
5,"August 23, 2017"," Smaller space required and no more notification , love it"
3,"August 13, 2017"," Only downloaded for the use of sending photos and it cant even do that, just gives an error msg every time"
3,"August 13, 2017"," It would be better if it had colored backgrounds,  gif features,  my day,  etc.  Otherwise it's a decent app"
1,"December 3, 2017", Worst bloody app I've ever used too many ads and it doesn't even work properly
4,"August 2, 2017", A lot less of a resource hog than fb
2,"August 14, 2017", Not Good. This app & facebook web browsing are same. Not stra future.
5,"August 17, 2017"," Best messenger alternative and most reliable one I've used. But chat heads would be very nice to have integrated. Other than that, very good."
5,"August 12, 2017", This app is so much more convenient than regular Facebook. I love it. A gotta have.

2,"August 23, 2017", I can only view 3 post on fb when i scroll down i get only the same 3 post
5,"August 23, 2017", By far the best messenger app the only downside is no Facebook calling
4,"August 29, 2017"," Good app,uses less data but sometimes won't hook up app levels,fix this problem and it would be better"
4,"August 17, 2017"," Im undecided about this app,  however it does seem much simpler than the two separate fb and messenger apps."
5,"July 28, 2017"," Great app, so far no problems."
4,"August 1, 2017", Great app. Takes up a lot less space than Facebook.
4,"August 10, 2017", Works good and unlike Facebook messenger it doesn't overload my phone with emojis and lock me out of my own phone !!
5,"August 5, 2017", I love it except for no video calling In messenger.
4,"August 14, 2017", Works and does not hog memory on your phone for FB!
5,"August 11, 2017", Great app takes less space than fb app so great for smart phones with not much space
5,"July 29, 2017", it's amazing it helps to ignore people üòÇüòÇ

4,"August 17, 2017"," For the last month or so, photos in comments are rarely uploaded. Otherwise, great"
5,"August 26, 2017", Lot better than fb app
1,"July 31, 2017", Slowest app I've ever seen.
4,"August 15, 2017", Good..but I hate the ads
5,"August 31, 2017", I've loved every moment of it. Best alternative to Facebook there is honestly.
1,"August 24, 2017", Way to many glitches
4,"July 30, 2017", So far it has been a great experience.  Truly lite weight.
5,"August 13, 2017", I like it better everything is on one app facebook and messenger.
5,"August 15, 2017"," I think it's cool, but don't like the ads"
5,"August 16, 2017"," Excellent, non intrusive native app alternative!"
5,"August 13, 2017"," 10,000x better and faster, also not a resource hog!!!"
5,"August 29, 2017", Saves space on my smart phone compared to messenger.
5,"August 15, 2017", Awesome app. It's everything it promises
4,"August 19, 2017", Love so far on day 1!
5,"August 10, 2017", Great app.... Excellent lightweight replacement.

5,"July 29, 2017", I had nothing but trouble with Facebook kept flashing and i couldnt install. Facebook lite never crashes and stays on!! Well done!
2,"July 27, 2017"," Really slow and laggy for me... Feels bogged down, like a 2000s Flash website. It doesn't ""just work"" - notifications don't clear, takes a few seconds for my keyboard to pop up, bounces around between views or conversation progression. App never opens in the same place twice. Next!"
4,"July 28, 2017", Less ram usage make the mobile smoothly go...but Bad part is I cannot share anytype of images to other platforms as Instagram etc.. Please fix
4,"July 28, 2017", Need some improvements bit slow freeze and lags sometimes as well and most important notifications delay . Ignoring all this overall is Good . Thumbs upüëç
4,"July 29, 2017"," Takes what Facebook used to be before the messenger split,  and puts it all back together in a smooth application that WORKS.  CODING IS DONE RIGHT."
4,"July 27, 2017", Would like the option to share to custom chat rooms/group messages.  Great app!
5,"July 27, 2017", So far fantastic

I shared app on my wall and ads still not gone. I followed instructions bybsharing on wall and do remove ads again. The same message to share pops up again. Besides this iys a perfect app.  Already tried close and reopen.whenever i tap to remove ads i still get the same message to share on wall and tap on it again.
3,"July 25, 2017", Maximum time it is showing 'add friends to see more stories' in my timeline instead of posts. Please do something. Btw I have many friends in FB
5,"July 25, 2017"," Great replacement app for Facebook and messenger, no problems I've run into yet."
3,"August 6, 2017"," Voice & video call feature for lower versions must be added. It'll be better if chat heads can be added. otherwise, this is a perfect app"
5,"July 26, 2017", Too early  but so far ok
3,"July 25, 2017", It won't notify me of messages
5,"July 26, 2017", Simple FB layout. Great way to use messenger. Way better than the messenger app.
5,"July 25, 2017", very useful  low space

5,"July 20, 2017", Much better than messenger. I'm parinoid messenger records constantly when I'm not using it. Why else would a app need to be 90mbs+ ??!! After Snowden dropped the truth I don't trust facebook anymore. This app is the way to go.
4,"July 21, 2017", I really like the app so far work fast but only isuue when you launch app always messaging page comes why not news feed? Which is annoying me please fix
4,"July 14, 2017"," Very light, best alternative to heavy FB app. But it doesn't keep the position of my last visit and it often asks me to login again cuz it logs out alone, both of these things are annoying"
3,"July 15, 2017"," A decent, simple and useful app. Recently though it has been sending me notifications not just of messages that have been sent to me but also now it's notifying me of my own messages. This is annoying."
4,"July 12, 2017"," Space saver. 3.65 MB vs real FB messenger's 117 MB. Haven't noticed any glitches or seen any pop-up ads. Only problem, is it doesn't link to FB account's messenger button. Have to leave FB and go directly to app to read/send messages."
5,"July 20, 2017", Great app. I can upload 30 pics easily. Tagging never be this easy. Voice call quality is exceptional. I love how I can scroll the newsfeed smoothly and go to Messenger part quickly. This is the only wrapper that works for me!! Highly recommend!!!
4,"July 12, 2017", Getting use to the app. The only bad thing is trying to post from ur memories or message is hard to figure out. Other than that it's nice
5,"July 11, 2017", Pretty good alternative. Its size is small not like the original app just need some improvements and it's good!
4,"July 11, 2017"," Trying this app again. So far so good, if the notifications remain reliable, I'll keep it as my only fb app."
4,"July 18, 2017"," Hay seems ok so far BUT on my galaxy S5 in post for photo, it won't show CAMERA to take photo only gallery. My friends OPPO phone does. And could it be shown when uploading pics etc can there be a progress bar with % to show progress?"
2,"July 17, 2017", Woke up this morning to be notified on this app i was now friends with a ransom stranger. I didnt send a friends request nor did i recieve one. Needlees to say i logged out n uninstalled the app. I will not be using this app again. Not trustworthy.
5,"July 22, 2017", I disabled Facebook because it was taking up too much space and my messenger app never worked. This app has basically everything Facebook does and I can actually send and receive messages now! Great app :)
5,"July 17, 2017", Need to improvement ... Improve speed of app...its too lazyy. So slow..
4,"October 9, 2017"," This app works well as a replacement for messenger, but randomly shows up in connected devices as Windows PC"
4,"July 15, 2017", why you guys not working on gifs ? overall the app is very good except that it doesn't play gifs. We have to open gif in other browser. Work on it so that we can see gifs in this application itself.
1,"July 13, 2017", It saves data because everything takes longer to load when not in WiFi. I just wanted messenger not news feed. If you disable pictures you can't tell who's talking in a group chat.
2,"July 24, 2017", Was my favorite app. Now I can't post status on Facebook. I click upload pic and after I select the photo it reloads to the Messages page. Please fix (Samsung On5)
2,"July 9, 2017", It was great until the Trending page stopped working it been almost 4 months fix it
1,"July 14, 2017",Awful Can't even post any pics now..
3,"July 11, 2017",Where's the video call? I give 5 star if you will tell me how to use video call!?
5,"July 22, 2017", This app is way better than installing Facebook and Facebook Messenger it's everything on 1 for a smaller hard drive space I would recommend all Android users to use this app
4,"July 22, 2017", I think ye acha hai main FB se Kum jagha leta hai but kabhi kabhi isme text format bigadh jata hai so wese acha hai main FB unsorted hota tha ye nhi hota
3,"July 11, 2017", I rate it 3 star coz it doesn't support writing from right to left like Arabic or Hebrew
3,"July 14, 2017"," App has bugs like Fullscreen video zooms way too much, notification icon vanishing etc."
4,"July 20, 2017"," Generally OK,I dislike the ads bar at the bottom."
5,"July 14, 2017", It's very easy to use. All features provided in this app is very good.
5,"July 17, 2017"," Ilovethis....but so slow for my phone,pls fix for meüò¢"
5,"July 13, 2017", Finally got both of them together . No one should have to download the apps separate again
4,"July 11, 2017", This app is very good for news feed and chat....but should be messenger lite as a fb messenger for chatting and emoji... then will be more better
5,"July 9, 2017", I think this apps is good co'z no need to download it one by one together in one is better .
5,"July 16, 2017", Great app! Just wish I was able to go on the market like normal facebook
5,"July 13, 2017", Great uses so little memory and switches from FB to messenger effortlessly. I recommend it for everyone especially the person with no sd card.
5,"July 17, 2017", Please remove ads then it will be the finest Facebook app.
5,"July 11, 2017", If Messaging good... Then whole app will be in good place... Messages are arriving Very slowly
4,"July 26, 2017"," Only been using the app a short time, so far I'm very happy with it's performance. Delivers on all it's promises."
5,"July 14, 2017", i love using this more Dan anything else keep up the good work
4,"July 18, 2017"," Very good, but Vibration function on notifications and messages is not working for me. Please fix it. :)"
1,"July 22, 2017", why do we need to install another messenger app to send messages?
5,"July 11, 2017", I dnt knew because I dnt try out the GIF and voicemail yet.
5,"July 22, 2017", Fab! Does what says on the tin very well... My phone loves it... Getting rid of the FB app and messenger was fantastic !!

Only a couple of small complaints which is why I'm giving it four instead of five stars....I can't send a new message to anyone on my list because it tells me to download messenger and I can't upload a picture straight from my gallery because it tells me I don't have permission. I may just be doing something wrong. Overall excellent app that works great if you need to save space!
5,"July 5, 2017"," Edit from my last review, developer told me to download the beta version of the app to fix some issues, and it did in fact work. Using the @ sign followed by the users name to tag them is the answer! Thank you for the reply!"

Around three years ago it was perfectly fine when Facebook supported the OS with the full versions of Facebook and Messenger. Now it's impossible to comment without half the post missing for some strange unknown reason, and messages send without pressing the send button. Far too frustrating to be usable on mini phones with Android 4.2."

4,"May 21, 2017"," Love that this takes up so much less space on my phone! Works well, and is easy to figure out. Does some things I can't just by using FB on my browser. My only complaint is that I wish I could access the marketplace! But that's minor."
2,"June 23, 2017", For just looking at fb or commenting it's good but I added it for the messenger and it does not give me any notifications if someone fb messages.  How do I know I ued my hubbies phone to snd me a message didnt notify me. But another app I use on my tablet did so not what I added it 4.
3,"May 15, 2017", Came back to app. Can now view comments and image uploads has an option to use FB app for faster uploads. Request... Would like to share a post and type in a friend's name (mention) for post without tagging them. Not sure if that's a feature only available for native FB app.
5,"May 11, 2017"," UPDATE: Just Bought It! 99cents is a steal. Nimble, fast, lite on the background data usage and not a bloated obese gorilla like the official FB. Good on phones, and it's simply terrific on a tablet. Suck it up and purchase, tight wad this is worth it."
4,"May 28, 2017", Its works good and is very practical idk why facebook requires 2 apps in the first place and why its so freaking big. One thing I realy dont like though is the 4k picture of venice that's fake but also it lags a lot
3,"May 31, 2017"," I really like this app... when it isn't taking 40 years to load a page. I thought this was supposed to be ""lite"" - shouldn't these issues be virtually non-existent?   Also, it sucks when it freezes and after a minute, sends you back to your messages"
5,"July 6, 2017"," Simply the best Facebook app around. Was sick of having  Messenger  and Facebook as huge battery drainers. A mere 6 mb, no major energy drain, and it is slicker and more versatile than FB on browser. Absolutely love it."

3,"May 20, 2017"," Decent, but clumsy. Too many push notifications, and no quick way to disable them per guidelines upon their receipt.   Handy alternative to messenger, but viewing the Facebook website is still easiest for general use."
4,"May 9, 2017"," Loved it. Light and let's me do anything, including share to page and group. 1000x better than the original. Only issue is it does not let me take pictures instantly from the post box, only from the gallery of pictures taken."
2,"May 19, 2017", Why in heavens name can't you save pics??? Pls fix this and then I'll give 5 and share
