4,"July 17, 2018"," I love this addicting game! However I dislike that there was NO option for 
a tutorial (I downloaded it based on reviews then had to use Google to 
figure out what I was doing) and sometimes the controls skip after I swipe, 
which results in the tiles moving in a way I'm not too sure I instigated.

which results in the tiles moving in a way I'm not too sure I instigated. 
Would Also be really cool if there were a more social aspect, such as total 
high scores or among friends, or even ways to competitively play."
5,"July 4, 2018"," It is incredibly addicting! I usually get bored of a game in a week or so, 
but I've been playing this for months and cant get enough. It is perfect 
because you can just pick it up and play anytime. I have gotten so close to 
2048 at least a dozen times, but it's incredibly hard to do."
3,"July 4, 2018"," This is a great game, great time passer but on Android I've consistently 
had a problem with it randomly making moves on its own ultimately making me

had a problem with it randomly making moves on its own ultimately making me 
lose all my progress. I'm done, I got so far this time and all that 
progress was lost, I can't bring myself to keep playing this game if that's 
what's going to happen everytime I make this much progress."
5,"July 6, 2018"," Great fun game. Lots of time to waste here. Easy to play, you'll keep 
coming back to it and you can fulfill that 'need to play something but I've 
only got a few seconds' bug."
5,"July 2, 2018"," Needs a 0.25 second cooldown between swipes to prevent accidental double 
swiping. Other than that minor issue, this is the best mobile game. Period."
2,"July 11, 2018"," While the game is great and everything.. Its perpetually crashing, 
sometimes I even lose progress on the game that I'm playing.. Hope this can 
be fixed. Thank you."
5,"July 16, 2018"," We need to stop games like these. SAID NO ONE EVER. this game is so 
addicting! I can't stop!! love it 10/5 stars. :)"
3,"July 7, 2018"," Great game, but sometimes the game will double swipe randomly, maybe 
because it's too sensitive to some of the touches? Makes it more difficult 
to win!"
5,"July 8, 2018"," Simple, fun, and challenging. Can get addictive. They have different levels 
for once you master the original goal of vetting 2048. However once you 
achieve 2048 you can keep going to see what's the largest combo you can 
make. Highly recommend!"
5,"July 14, 2018"," Straight forward and to the point. I've spent hours getting lost in trying 
to achieve that elusive number... As well as it's larger iterations."
4,"July 2, 2018"," Just don't go too fast, it glitches which can be really annoying, 
especially if you are in free play"
5,"July 8, 2018"," I love this number puzzle game! Its very easy to learn and there are 
different size game board u can choose from so once u master one bard u can 
try the next! So much fun and a great time killer!"
5,"July 2, 2018"," After a sum time by playing this game the eyes get tired , you should make 
the game's background black ,, please make an update about it"
5,"July 14, 2018"," Probably one of the best 2048 games available, as you can alter the grid 
size. A bigger grid (5x5 or more) significantly increases your ability to 
gain a good score"
5,"July 4, 2018"," 2048 is a no-nonsense game that's right to the point and can provide for 
countless hours of recreation. It is by far my favorite app on my phone, as 
I have spent countless hours in waiting rooms, classrooms, restrooms, and 
car rides just amusing the hell out of myself with this game. great game. ...Full Review2048 is a no-nonsense game that's right to the point and can provide for

5,"July 5, 2018"," Good, mindless, addictive game. I should say I don't like it because it 
keeps me from doing things I need to do lol"
3,"July 9, 2018"," It's a good game and addicting. However it will sometimes make moves by 
itself and I can't undo it making me lose the order I had it in."
5,"July 5, 2018"," You combine randomly placed twos and fours to create higher numbers and 
combine them until you get to the total 2048. afterwards you can keep going 
until you've reached numbers in multi billions"
1,"July 18, 2018"," Bugs where it either double swipes or flips the entire board happen way too 
often, also there's way too many ads for such a simple game."
3,"July 17, 2018"," It would be great if we would have check points. In case we make any 
mistake we would be able to start the game again from the check point"
5,"July 12, 2018"," I doubt if there is any one who have made this much high score. I have 
scored 4431796. And score in single box is 262144."
4,"July 17, 2018"," This game was a little hard to grasp at first, but once I got the hang of 
it it was fun to play, and a good thing to fidget with while listening to 
things like speeches."
5,"July 3, 2018"," If I didn't spend so much time playing this game, I could probably figure 
out how much time I've spent playing this game."
5,"July 8, 2018"," Just kills your Precious time!! I have been playing it for continous 3 
hours. Just how how addictive can this game be?? Loved it."

real issues."

2,"July 15, 2018"," This version kept glitching out and registering multiple swipes, making me 
lose."
5,"July 12, 2018"," Distracts me from my anxiety; a good way to focus on something other than 
whats going on in my head honestly. I use it often to help cope"
5,"July 3, 2018"," This is an addictng game to play because of its simplicity. I am a fan of 
puzzle games and this one is great because it can be played whenever you 
have a spare moment. I highly recommend this game."

..."
5,"July 17, 2018"," This is an amazing Game for when you are chilling out on the couch and it 
calms your mind after something bad or upsetting"
2,"July 6, 2018"," Freezes on galaxy s9+ after ""do you want to play again"" and ""do you want to 
keep playing"""
5,"July 16, 2018", When I stress I always play this it made me forget the moment
3,"July 14, 2018"," It's fun and does what it's supposed to, but if you're going to have an 
option to spend 0.99$ and remove ads, it better actually REMOVE THE ADS."
1,"July 16, 2018", Change the game's name to 4096 bcoz I have made it.
5,"July 5, 2018"," Has undo but on, has different sized boards, doesn't have autosolver, 3.14 
out of pi stars"
3,"July 12, 2018"," This particular app doesn't have the automatic play feature that allows the 
game to continue in whatever direction you choose which saves on finger 
swipes."
5,"July 13, 2018", Awesome. Time consuming and addictive
5,"July 12, 2018", It helps me with my anxiety and panic attacks
5,"July 10, 2018"," Fun game, simple mechanics make it easy to pick up and learn but is still 
challenging and makes you think about your moves."

boring. Consider adding themes and challenges the way some other classic 
games have done. Otherwise, the app itself is great. No bugs, no crashes."
3,"May 28, 2018"," It keeps shutting down now, can't open the app. Otherwise a great game. My 
mom's is also shutting down so it's not just my phone. Fix and I'll update."
4,"June 16, 2018"," I love this game super addictive. I have it on multiple devices. The only 
issue is when I play it on my phone it'll freeze up for a second and then 
it looks like my board has moved 2 or 3 times"
1,"June 16, 2018"," Nice game.  Fast and easy to play.  However, every time a game ends you are forced to watch an advertisement.  Every time is simply obnoxious.  I might pay for the game if it were less pushy with the ads... Uninstalled.  :("

sequentially swipe the finger in circles: up, left, down, right, rinse 
repeat. The reason is because game adds low numbers to be stucked in random 
cells and by moving the array in circle you just spread them and absorb by 
array at random location, avoiding the main killer of this game: a stacked 
up corner of high numbers. After gameplay is defeated with the dumbest 
strategy, the game kinda sucks."
1,"June 13, 2018"," It's a ripoff of the original one. I made sure it was the real one by 
checking if 128 would glow and it did not so I uninstalled it because it 
was a RIPOFF"
3,"June 15, 2018"," The game was great until it stopped letting me continue after I won 2048. 
If that feature comes back, I'll update my review"
1,"June 13, 2018"," Game clearly intentionally spawns a 4 to fill final space to force gameover 
and show more ads. There are too many ads to begin with. Not acceptable."
5,"June 6, 2018"," I love it! Great for those moments when you need to zone out. You can put 
as little or as much thought into it as you want. Nice a simple concept but 
definitely a challenge."

5,"May 16, 2018"," I love it. It's great to pass the time. It's easy to play, yet challenging 
enough to keep you playing"
4,"June 10, 2018"," Give us more colors for above 2048, i'm not dumbly swiping the screen so 
its challenging to get 16384 but feels like it looks boring, give some 
better colorings and take your 5th star"
4,"May 25, 2018"," Its a great game though the ads are quite alot and annoying whenever 
internet's on."
2,"June 22, 2018"," The ads in this app are so obnoxious. It essentially forces you to click on 
ads (by accident). I've uninstalled this and installed an ad free version. 
Check the Google Play store for a 2048 app that's ad free."
5,"May 8, 2018", To be very honest... it's a kind of addiction... you can't get enough of it
5,"July 2, 2018"," It took a few games to understand the system, but then it became very fun. 
Going to change to larger grids to increase the challenge."
5,"June 3, 2018"," This game is a good time killer and allways... even when you have beaten a 
level, is allways fun to do again."
5,"May 20, 2018"," I think i broke the game, just keep swiping in a clockwise motion"
1,"May 22, 2018"," It is completely impossible to start again after ""game over"". So I've been 
able to play 1 time and never again."
5,"May 12, 2018"," Very addictive! I couldn't sleep one night and I just kept going and going. 
On the 4x4 board I scored 288,780."
5,"May 25, 2018", Basic brainless time suck.But I can't seem to stop playing.
2,"June 25, 2018"," There is no way to remove the ads. I'm sick of accidently swiping too far 
down and getting a webpage that pops up."

of the box already hit 1048576"

interacting with this application. 5 boxes of popcorn"

ruining the game you've dedicated hours to. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION OF 
THE GAME."

and the game is ruined"
3,"July 1, 2018"," Phone gets hot during game play. The app uses overclocking and shady stuff. 
Uninstalled."
2,"May 5, 2018", Full screen ads take off a few stars. Also controls are sometimes finicky.
1,"June 19, 2018", The ads are for a racist blackface event. That's just not ok

3,"June 26, 2018"," Smooth gameplay, but extremely annoying and obtrusive ads."

as possible."
3,"June 14, 2018"," A concept is simplistic and although the game is a slightly boring, it can 
be addictive!"
4,"June 6, 2018", Nice and simple game. Quite addictive though.

used to just keep your hands busy."
4,"June 24, 2018"," This game is better than the original but sometimes the ads make you swipe 
and it ruins the game"

of this game though, because they appear to be so horrifically stupid that 
they can't read that. Here, I'll explain it to you, it means your game is 
flipping trash!"
1,"March 2, 2018", When i started the game first time... first it asked money to remove add...have some patience . If a persons likes your game he or she will definitely pay you ...it is like you are asking a guest money to enter your house... nonsense

After having a quick 10-15 minutes play I feel refreshed without the guilt of wasting time as I used to have with social media. Good concept for a game, thanks makers."
2,"April 23, 2018"," what a stupid game. I beat my previous high score, (when I was trying) of 
3220 by simply swiping in a clockwise direction. I got a high score of 5200

left, up, right. Try it, you'll probably beat your own high score too."

Sometimes it will double move when you've only pressed to move once and you can only undo one time so you're basically screwed. I got up to over 447 thousand and it did this and ruined it all. Then it plays loud ads.

""quit"" button. What is that so difficult ."

4,"April 2, 2018"," Need to fix the swipe sensitivity, at pivotal times when I swiped left or right the boxes would move up or down. Other than that, good killer when waiting in line."
3,"January 17, 2018", Love the game.  Very addictive.  My complaint is that after playing a very long time and getting to a very good place the game can occasionally misinterpret a move and scramble the board.  You cannot recover from that and it ruins the game.
5,"March 27, 2018", This game will leave the most astute math nerds entrenched. Very addicting though so be warned.   Developers: please make ads less intrusive or offer premium.
5,"February 7, 2018"," Warning: highly addictive, adds option of 5x5, has undo and restart button.  Showed my mother this, she stays up late doing this game regardless of her need for sleep."
3,"May 3, 2018"," The game is rather nice except for the annoying glitch that often happens 
in late game. It makes 2 swipes at once and always in the direction you 
don't want it to move. After several ruined games I'm going to another app, 
fortunately there are plenty 2048 puzzles on the market."
5,"March 2, 2018"," Addictive, so use at your own risk. Ads are not annoying or intrusive."
5,"April 6, 2018", Very addictive! You will want to play the same level over and over to see just how high of a score you can get.
5,"March 29, 2018", Great time passer. I have about an hour bus drive to school everyday so the fact you can play offline is very useful. I've spent hours on this game and I would definitely recommend to someone.
5,"April 12, 2018"," A very addictive, fun game. Other reviews are right: good for passing the time, while still being challenging to find the best strategy."
5,"February 20, 2018", This is game is soooo addictive! I might just fail my exams because I'm playing it waayyy too much. Love it.

2,"February 20, 2018", The maker modified the game to give 4s in the critical time so that game ends and ad comes. Probably justified by revenue making angle. But otherwise nice game
