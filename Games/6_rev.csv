4,"January 2, 2016","Good game. I like the game really well, only I think there should be lives so when you lose, you can get like three tiles taken away and you can continue, just that you can only do that twice in a round. If you do that twice, then you have to start all over and your progress will be lost.

5,"October 4, 2016",Really nice Like it a lot. Only wish I could use undo even after game over. (PS. My previous review mentioning bad performance was caused by another app.)
5,"October 17, 2016",Very addictive First played this on my daughters app Tom car...was mini game....now I'm hooked. Find myself playing this over and over :)
5,"May 17, 2016", Very addictive game. Husband gets upset I'm on do long. lol
4,"March 23, 2016",Great There are loads of other 2048 on GP and this one is the best because it has a great interface distinguishing colors but it will have 4 stars until they fix the menu witch is dorky still best 2048 on GP
2,"April 3, 2016","Flashing ads The flashing ads on the bottom of this game drove me mad. Don't usually mind ads, I get why we have them. Had to uninstall it for these horrendous ads alone."
3,"February 8, 2016",Shuts down w/o warning This app simply stops working and closes without warning. There's got to be a bug or two somewhere.
5,"January 24, 2016",So relaxing This game is so relaxing my parents just had a big fight and I was crying so hard and this game just called me down
5,"May 31, 2016",Awesome I enjoyed it very well... But there is a mistake.. There is no back step option in this... If this will be also there... Then it will be✌✌✌
5,"August 1, 2016", I first started playing this game on the tablet when I was locked up. It's addictive
5,"May 9, 2016",Keeps me thinking Very challenging and makes me think a bit. Excellent app/game to play for a spare few minutes .
5,"January 2, 2016","Great version of 2048! It has the option of sound effects, looks beautiful with nice smooth animations, good gameplay and pace. What is not to like? (Except for ads maybe but thats available)"
3,"April 5, 2016","Fun, few hiccups Freezes up and have to reset, but only once and a while."
4,"March 27, 2016",Addicting!!!! Love it. Never freezes.. smooth ... customizable... only suggestion is to add the option to use own images for background (colors). Thnx for this fun app!
5,"December 20, 2015", I love 2048 games but this one is extra special because you can customize the colors on it. I play this game all the time.
1,"February 27, 2016","Worst Some modifications should be done, bcause the way tiles move is really very bad if u want to move a particular column or row all other tiles which don't belong to that column also move ! Just irritating..!!"
5,"March 20, 2016",Nice puzzle Nice piece to keep me relax any time am stressed out. You can improve on the animation.
4,"April 20, 2016", Some silly banner ads at the bottom to ignore but otherwise very responsive and playable with no disruptive full screen ads.
5,"April 2, 2016", Great game!! One of my stress relief game ever
5,"August 10, 2016", Love it . it is too much interesting and makes my brain capable in calculating . it helps in fast calculation .i want to say that please make such types of brain games which could help me more .  thanks for giving such a nice game
5,"January 6, 2016",Very nice But a small prob.... Can't change the background...... It's quite disappointing.....!!!
