2,"March 12, 2017"," This was my favorite app, until the update. It ruined gameplay. There were constant ads.

3,"March 14, 2017", This was just perfect until the last update which totally ruined the game play. After a week I was about to reach 32768 but there were no more undo moves. Just a pop up which asks to watch a video and there isn't even a video to watch. Come on fix your game.
4,"March 16, 2017", The Ads are really annoying. In the 3√ó3 mode. You don't get any undo moves without watching ads

I also saw the swipe sensitivity issue, but wonder if that's more an issue with my Note 5 and or OS. Remove the score limit, and it would be worth a 5 rating."
5,"February 12, 2017"," Great game! I like it better than the first one because there are different size boards and stuff. There are some swipes that are misread every once in a while, but it's not a big deal"
5,"March 7, 2017"," CRAZY ADDICTIVE...challenging, too. I'd like to have more color contrast for when my eyes are tired and I have trouble reading the numbers. Could use more undo/go back because of the times the game reads 2 moves when I only made 1."
1,"December 30, 2016",Lots of misread swipes The controls are overly sensitive and result in a lot of unintentional moves. I've played a lot of 2048 versions but I'd pass on this one.
4,"January 4, 2017","Great There is an undo that is good for accidental swipes but, it only will undo one move so it isn't too overpowered. It will only let you get to 131072."
5,"December 29, 2016",Very much intresting If you once start playing this game your mind never tries tonleave it because it is very much intresting game
5,"January 20, 2017", Different board sizes. Super fantastic. I am addicted to huge one. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
3,"February 15, 2017", Game stops once your title reaches 131072. Days of hard work wasted
5,"February 13, 2017"," It's a little too easy to make accidental swipes, but that's fixed by the redo button that lets you retry your last step."

Many times when i was trying to move left, it would move up; down and the game would move the process to the right; etc. These mistakes make the game winnable only by chance."

Also, add a 9x9 Board, and I have worked with the 3x3 and found out the highest tile possible is 1024, so maybe change it from 2048 to 1024. Other than that, LOVING IT"
4,"January 3, 2016",Bigger boards pointless Good game. Bigger boards make it too easy. Standard game is a nice 20 minute distraction to finish.

3,"July 8, 2016", I like the game and it's challenges  but i think my version had a glitch and it kept messing up my game play. Sometimes It would just jump to a random side of the board
