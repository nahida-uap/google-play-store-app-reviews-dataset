4,"February 16, 2016","Slow Since latest update, it's moving very slow.  The animations are fine, but the time it takes from my finger movement to display is too slow.  I was already moving ahead of the animations before, but now I don't even want to play due to the latency."
2,"May 21, 2016", Good idea. +1 for Open Source.  Edit: Cannot stand blurriness anymore.
5,"June 24, 2016",Addiction maximized My daughter (a Mathie)  told me about this game.  I am happy there is an undo button now.  I wish this version were available for the Kindle.
4,"January 16, 2016",Fundamental flaw Sometimes drops a 4 instead of a 2.  I suspect the error is in the source code because another ad free version does the same.  A bothersome glitch.
1,"February 27, 2016",Keeps crashing Since I upgraded my android this game keeps crashing.
5,"April 23, 2016",Addictive I first became a fan of this game when i got an app that u had to earn coins to unlock diffrent colored lights. How u got coins was to play games and it just happened tbat one of the mini games was this kind of game!!!

1,"January 11, 2016","Update Was good, but the update made it horribly slow, I mean it takes up to 3 seconds to make a move, that's a nightmare! Very slow, don't like it anymore."
4,"January 12, 2016"," The Undo stack should be limited otherwise it slows down immensely, and at a score of 214k the game itself simply stops responding (the UI and the undo/new game buttons still work)."

4,"September 21, 2014",rough around the edges i dislike that it changes it's appearance when i long press down(4 sec) which is odd behaviour and distracting. otherthan that it's very good. give it a try. WARNING: this game is addicting.
4,"April 4, 2015",Great for just playing the game I just installed and played about five times already. I really like that there are no pop-ups or ads. The only thing that was a little bothersome was the slight lag in the moving of the tiles. It's not even that big of a deal.
5,"December 23, 2014","Great  implementation Perfect, except that the ""try again"" button can easily be pressed accidentally upon reaching 2048 tile, thus resetting the game. Also the ""keep trying"" button is registered as a move when pressed, repeating the last move."

5,"September 22, 2014","Great app, lots of fun This is a perfect port of 2048 without ads or any undesirable ""features"" included. It might not have an undo feature but that just makes you a better player IMO. Great app!"

1,"June 14, 2014",Changing review from 5 to 1 star The update had killed the game. The touch controls are utterly unresponsive. What have you done developers.This was my favorite game. HTC one m7 user here.
5,"July 11, 2014","A Simple and Clean 2048 Implementation When my kids were falling to the frenzy of 2048, I searched for the simplest app closest in implementation to the original website.  This seems to be it!  My only gripe is the Game Over text covers the tiles so I can't get good screenshots of my highest ones..."
2,"June 18, 2014",Fun but last update Last update seems to have changed the sensitivity of the screen. Moves have to be more deliberate to take effect. Sometimes it takes several attempts before a move will register and happen. Previous version was much better.
4,"August 1, 2014"," Its 2048 after all! Who dislikes it. This particular app is interesting because it doesn't ask for any special purposes. But then, a little more snappy please?"
4,"June 17, 2014",Great app and game But takes up a lot of your battery... Would not recommend playing if you're on a long journey and need battery for long hours. Would rate it 5 star if it doesn't drain battery life. Xperia Z1 compact
3,"July 1, 2014",Fun but. Really like the no permissions and its fun but It feels like there is a delay when I make a move. The area of play is too small. Going to install a different app.
3,"June 21, 2014",Sensitivity issues There are issues with sensitivty of swiping since it was updated. It sometimes lags or takes a few tries to swipe the tiles. Galaxy s4
1,"July 26, 2014","CLAMF Every time I get 1024 the screen mysteriously becomes hypersensitive and the slightest brush sends the tiles caroming.  Once or twice is my fault, every time has to be an error."
5,"June 14, 2014",Best for requiring no permissions A big thank you to the developer(s) for producing a simple version of this game that requires no special permissions.  Down with leaderboards!
4,"June 20, 2014","Love the game, but... ...something happened on the last update. I now have to swipe several times for the motion to register. It isn't all the time, but it's enough that I get frustrated and often back out of the app to try again later. Otherwise, I love this game."
5,"June 17, 2014",Love it Thank you developer. This is the only 2048 game that doesn't require permission to read any content on my device.

5,"July 23, 2014",Best of all I tried all 2048 games on the store!  And this is by far the best! Almost identical to the original.. Very very tiny! No ads! Also utilize lower ram compared to others.. Just plain and simple!  Thanks!
5,"June 22, 2014",Great port of a great game This is probably the smallest sized version of 2048 and the only one that doesn't require additional permissions to snoop data on your photo.
3,"June 23, 2014", Its a good game but slow to respond I'm this version. I prefer this game to be fast paced and the non responsiveness of this version takes the thrill out of the game
5,"June 17, 2014",Quality I would have given it a 4 because it has a bit of lag but its lack of permitions gave it a 5 from me

3,"June 1, 2014","A good addictive game Gets a little boring once you've worked out how to solve it though. Also steals battery and can lag since it some how manages to use 100% of the cpu when active, which it should not do. Mostly marked it down because of this, it limits play time."
5,"April 23, 2014"," Simple, no ads, clean interface. Time to look for a way to throw a couple bucks at the Dev(s?).  Only concern is that sometimes the long click that gets out of full screen gets triggered accidentally while I'm thinking, but that's my problem, not theirs."
3,"April 29, 2014",Annoying popup I often accidentally restart the game when I hit 2048. Would be better if the popup was not on the main stage when you reach 2048. Or just have the option to never have that message show up.
3,"May 12, 2014",Too power hungry Love the game. It makes time and my battery disappear. Like no ads and permissions but wish it left some power for phone calls.
2,"May 8, 2014",No adverts but very laggy Great game play but game gets slower and slower as you play it to the point of being unplayable and frustrating - repeatedly sliding and waiting for a response. Sorry have had to uninstall it
3,"June 1, 2014","Good game, but has some programming issues. The game itself is fun. Its the only version, to my knowledge, that doesn't require permissions, but it does have response-time issues. It's easier just to go on my browser and play it on the website than to deal with the app's unresponsive game play."

Sometimes the game refuses to respond to any swipe except one in a particular direction, and that direction may well be one which you do not wish to take, and thus you are compelled to do something that will sabotage your momentum and/or strategy."
5,"April 22, 2014",Nice and Simple.  No Permissions needed! Gotta love it when a dev gets it right.  Just wish I could get back all the hours I've lost to this game.

You also helped me with my nuttella rations, nom nom nom!"
3,"May 26, 2014","Nice but... It's very addicted and generally  it's a good game. But it's unresponsive (or not fluid) sometimes and, strangely, consumes a great percentage of battery."

2,"May 24, 2014",Very laggy Sorry i had to unninstal. But the no ads idea is cool though
5,"May 15, 2014","Awesome app, without any permissions This app doesn't have any required permissions, making it the best 2048 app on the play store."
3,"May 3, 2014",Screen jumps The screen jumps up and down due to score animation. otherwise nice no ad action.
4,"May 6, 2014","Good simple game Ideal for wasting time when you are waiting for someone, or a bus or a train,etc. Very nice and simpole with no ads and plays well"
2,"June 1, 2014","Jumpie A little small would be better if screen was filled ,jerky tile move screen flash and refresh when tiles are moved and slow response to finger swipe"
5,"April 26, 2014",Addiction I play it everyday! love the game! Superrrrr addicted to it XD
3,"May 16, 2014"," Pretty good but the game is a bit unresponsive. Needs a little tweaking. Other than that, great :)"
5,"May 3, 2014","I was just trying to do this! As one of my first apps, beginning developer, I was trying to make this but this is better (Mine has no storage yet, and it has the rotate bug...) I will see if I can try from yours... (Grr... Why HTML5 storage??????) :D"
5,"May 5, 2014","I never see my wife I never see my wife not because I'm playing it all the time,but I am,cause she's playing it all the time too."
2,"April 25, 2014",Swiping lags Extremely slow to respond as the game progresses. Had to swipe 2-3 times to complete an action.
5,"May 13, 2014","Near perfect No ads, no bloat, just the game. Perfect... Though I'd love to see a 'full screen' mode that ditches the explanation and uses the actual full screen for the game+score."
1,"May 10, 2014","awful, laggy and non functional It takes seconds to respond to touches and sometimes doesn't respond at all..."
5,"May 9, 2014",Hooked Very cool and time consuming. Haven't yet solved but came close.

5,"May 18, 2014",Great! Was badly surprised when Gabrielle brought out his own version of the game on the play store... But with adds.  Thanks for keeping it original!
4,"May 11, 2014",Add themes for game Night mode themes would be great. As we are playing in bed at night and the screen just way to bright lmao other than that awesome game

3,"May 12, 2014","No Credit I got to 2048 but it never gave me the tile in the upper left hand corner, so it's like I never even got it and it sucks."
5,"April 23, 2014",No permissions! A game that doesn't want access to your whole phone! 5 stars now that it's smooth as can be. Wonderful update!
