5,"June 10, 2018", It's 2048. No ads. No gimmicks. Just the game. Perfect.
5,"July 2, 2018", An amazing port of the original game

update"
4,"June 9, 2018", Icon is missing

Something that's unheard of nowadays."
5,"March 31, 2018"," Great app, looks great and works as it should. The only problem is that it crashes at least 3 times during any game for me. I'm not even sure it's a crash because I can just go right back on the app without any problems. It just randomly sends me to my home screen. Anyway, my high score is 376,520. ...Full ReviewGreat app, looks great and works as it should. The only problem is that it crashes at least 3 times during any game for me.

That took me a while and a lot of undos"
5,"March 22, 2018", Almost perfect version of the game. The only issue is not very good detection of swipes. Sometimes it just does nothing. Other versions don't have this problem. Maybe it's better to increase sensitivity of the swipe gesture?
5,"February 21, 2018"," Fantastic! No ads, no distractions, just minimalist version of one of my favorite puzzle games. Can't see any reason anyone looking for a basic 2048 game would rate this anything less than 5 stars."
5,"October 7, 2017"," It's a great game no matter how you play it, but this is the best version to download. No ads and no weird permissions that other versions want. Just how it should be - Big kudos to the developer for that alone."
5,"January 31, 2018", Love this game.  I beat it almost every time I play.  So for me the trick is the highest double.    One thing I wish it has was a timer.  Then I could track and try and beat my personal best time.
5,"June 5, 2018"," Great game, challenging at the highest numbers. Got up to 8192, with high 
score over 163k. Working to get higher"
5,"March 18, 2018"," Overall it's a great game with features and benefits as stated by others. I would like it more if the higher value tiles were a different colour. I have just made 8192 but it's black, same as 4096."
5,"March 1, 2017"," This is exactly what this sort of game should be. There is massive community involvement with expanding language localization, no permissions, extremely simple, and open source, AND NO ADS! Love the amazing work. Keep it up."
5,"November 3, 2017"," The best 2048 game because it is smooth, has no ads, requires no purchases, and requires no permissions! My highest score is over 281,000 so far! Very addictive."
5,"October 15, 2017"," The only 2048 worth downloading, the rest have ads which makes no sense for an open source game."
5,"October 13, 2017"," I achieved the perfect score 3890688. All tiles from 131072, 65536, 32768 to 8192 to 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4. I was hoping at the end the game will give me a ""8"" so that I can actually reach the 262144 tile. Did not happen but still appreciate the smooth controls and good graphics."
5,"June 21, 2018"," I'm addicted. Some games go for days. My current best score is 839934. 
Going for the MILLION!"
4,"March 27, 2018"," Great app! Simple, intuitive and to the point. I just really wish I could have the option to sign in and save my progress for when I get a new phone!"
5,"October 21, 2017", Best game ever. I like how when you lose you can just press redo and keep going.
4,"March 18, 2018", I rarely play games. I like this one. It's simple and can be challenging.
5,"June 20, 2017", Addictive on another level! Who knew math could be sooo FUN?!

is really good.üëç"
5,"February 4, 2018", Not sure of the 2048 goal.  My first game was over 9000.  A fun time killer.

4,"July 13, 2017"," I'm really liking this game. However, the controls are terribly stiff and spoil the fun. I have to swipe two or three times before they actually move. Online versions are much more sensitive and make for faster playing. Could you correct this please?"

5,"February 15, 2016","Fun time waster I had 2048 before and had to uninstall it because I was getting nothing done. I guess i don't learn too quickly,  because I just installed it again. This one is better than the one I had before - it runs faster, no ads, and it even has an undo feature that I haven't used yet."

I want to move the last row i will swipe inthe first row please fix this i love your  game but you need to still consider those who have low end phones :D
5,"September 1, 2015","Just WOW Usually these types of games are painstakingly slow, but this was really good. It kind of lags a little bit when you swipe, but I mean there are NO ADS so it's a pretty sweet deal ‚ò∫"
5,"December 7, 2015","Works, no issues, no ads Good work, although I didn't necessarily need another addictive time sink on my phone. That's my problem though."
5,"August 10, 2015","Very nice fork Good looking and good working. Supports high resolution, landscape mode, keyboard control. No annoying ads too. What more to ask for?"
3,"November 30, 2015",Its ok No add was really good. But need to swipe twice to make it work. Please improve it.
2,"August 30, 2015",Painfully slow This would be great if it wasnt so slow at responding to swipes. Sometimes the game doesnt register a swipe until 2 or 3 attempts.
3,"October 25, 2015","Pretty good I like the lack of adverts. Numbers occasionally shoot off in random directions when I swipe the screen in a completely unrelated direction which is sometimes rectified by the back button, but not always."
4,"September 13, 2015","Love it but... Would have gave it 5 stars if when you reach a certain point (32768 tile or any black colored tile) and you lose, the game gave you the option to start at a similar level. It takes so long to start from the beginning each time. Great game though!!"
4,"January 4, 2016"," Very good, but the undo button is definitely cheating. It would be perfect if there was no undo button OR if there was a little bit of text under the score that said ""Used undo button 1 time"" if you cheated."
4,"January 9, 2016","Great app Only issue is that the slider moves too fast/ is too sensitive to touch. Other than that, fantastic ad-free app!"
5,"December 15, 2015","Great! Great game. I love 2048. And this version has no ads, responds amazing, and is just absolutely perfect. Those who have issues, the issue is you're device"
5,"February 13, 2016",THE Best Port! Could never find anything that wasn't filled with ridiculous ads for something that was just a port in the first place. This is very very nice.
5,"June 30, 2015","Awesome - No ads no permissions Yep works exactly as listed, no ads and no permissions needed to run.   Snappy, no lags or crashes on my galaxy s5"
5,"December 31, 2015", I'm sorry I'm aticted. üòÇ No but srssly really good game! You should definitely donwnload It.
5,"January 17, 2016"," This game is awesome! No ads, easy undo for mistakes, etc."
2,"December 28, 2015","Freezes When I get the Game Over words appearing, the game freezes and I cannot start a new game."
3,"November 25, 2015","Game play issues You need to address the issues of NOT being able to retry (continue current game in play) when ""Game Over"" pops up, or to start a new game without having to press on the screen very hard or very many times to activate the options of retry or restart."
5,"April 30, 2015","Good app! No ads, beautiful gui as same as web version, smoothly, that's all i need at this app."
5,"June 29, 2015","Love this game! No ads and permissions Thanks for making this game have no ads and no permissions. One request, can you add the option to disable the undo button? I can't resist it some times and then it ruins my ""true"" high score. Thanks!"
5,"January 6, 2016",Amazing It really does give you a peace of mind to bid have to worry about ads. And the game looks amazing on its own
5,"October 8, 2015",I finally beat it Took me a while but finally did it. But now I find myself completing it almost every turn.
5,"September 24, 2015", Not only ad free but also less glitchy and rough than other 2048 apps.
3,"January 15, 2016",Good version but locks up Very nice implementation but can't restart when game ends.
5,"December 25, 2015",I love it It works perfectly I don't have to worry about the annoying ads and it works perfectly on my Samsung galaxy S6

5,"July 18, 2015",No ads. No permissions. Open source What more could you want? So addictive.

5,"June 26, 2015",Great Runs perfect no ads. Really happy with this app
3,"December 19, 2015", It is okay but it could be better by letting you earn diamonds and if you loose  you can use the diamonds to retry and keep the big numbers!
5,"January 18, 2016",Great addition to the original game The one step undo feature is an invaluable feature... It let me reach 32768..! Loved it..!
5,"December 31, 2015","Amazing! 2048 is a fun game, and then someone makes one, ADS FREE WITHOUT PAYING! Props to this guy/girl"

5,"October 24, 2014",Galaxy Note 3. Addictive. The best version of 2048. Simple and smooth interface. Keeps up with the speed of the stylus of this mobile. Can't stop playing.  Best part is that there are no levels. No waiting to connect to the net like Candy Crush. Highly recommended.
5,"November 18, 2014","One annoyance While the undo button is really nice because touch screen contols are a bit fiddly, i would like it better if it didn't randomize where it spawns the number every time."
4,"May 7, 2014",Simple & good Good implementation of 2048. My only complaint is the swipes required to make a move are too long which can get annoying imho.
5,"April 15, 2014","Great game, smooth and quick Love the no ads and no permissions. Most of the others are getting really pushy with ads. This game looks great, plays great and quick."
4,"October 23, 2014",Smooth But still appears to occasionally lag a bit. I find that MS Developers' version is slightly better in that regard.

4,"April 2, 2014","The restart button needs to move Good game but I keep having an issue with the start new game button being too close to the top right square. I find that very often sweeping up to the top right square causes me to restart the game, and the undo button doesn't reinstate my game. Which can be very frustrating"
5,"April 1, 2014","Clean and responsive No ads, no special perimssions, one step undo. Procrastinate to win 2048 points. Free of charge."
3,"April 2, 2014","Stops at 2048 Works well, but when you get to 2048, the game stops. You cannot keep on playing to try to get 4096 or more."

5,"April 3, 2014", NO AD! Great!!

2,"April 8, 2016",Slowed down nexus 5x This app slowed down my phone so much over time-- restarting did not help.  Uninstalling it made my phone amazing again

Unless I was tired or careless, it was easy to keep building higher and higher scores with more and more black squares (reached when 4096 is reached). I prefer games to continue to challenge me so I ended up uninstalling. My son's highest black square is 65 thousand-something. He's more patient than me."
5,"August 19, 2017", Very hard to put it down. Excellent when you only have a few minutes to play. So far at over 141000 and still going.. w an 8192 and a 4096 tile..
4,"November 29, 2016","The undo button makes winning to easy The new block should appear in the same place after an undo. The undo button is for mistakes, not changing tile places"
5,"June 4, 2015","Love lack of ads! I uninstalled simply because this particular game isn't interesting me right now, but when I want to play it again in the future, this is the one I'll download!!!!"
5,"May 18, 2018"," Addictive. Great way to waste anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 hours. I had to 
uninstall it because I wasted 5 hours playing yesterday. Still good though."
5,"July 17, 2016"," A simple, fun game and a great way to kill time. The game runs smoothly, and no ads means it doesn't eat up my data. I wish there were more games like this."
5,"March 28, 2016",I love it It was a little easy for me since I beat the game in 30 minuets but that 3p minuets was spread out over 3 days so my first highs core was 1308 then my next was 1585 the I reach 2052 I was so proud of myself üòÜüòá
5,"April 1, 2017",Very generous dev I love how generous the dev(s) were in making this port ad/permission free. And I'm happy that other languages get to enjoy this game now too. Lots of others would be trying to make money off of this.
5,"November 14, 2016",ADDICTING This game is so addicting I saw it on my sisters tablet and thought it was boring just by looking at it. But when I actually started playing it I decided to download it too.
2,"April 17, 2017", It's not perfect for me because it has no sound when I move the tiles. I really like hearing the classic click.
1,"July 10, 2016","Keeps crashing I had already reached 2048 when the app crashed. But when I opened the game back up, it put me back to where the highest tile was 1024!"
5,"January 30, 2017", My score now : 463208 and I can continue I got puzzle no 32768 It can be better if it will be online game and share scores

5,"June 22, 2018"," Thanks to the developer for creating this! Great to see the she ethical 
developers still out there who aren't just trying to scam people with 
hundreds of ads. Small file size, no permissions, no ads. Perfect!"
5,"May 4, 2015",As it should be Finally a nice game that doesn't require all the access in the world.  Which would be suspicious
