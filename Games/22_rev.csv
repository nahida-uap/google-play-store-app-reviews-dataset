4,"July 15, 2015","Highly addictive I have played this game on my i-Touch and loved it, but for Android it feels much better, with the different colors and ease of play. Great game just it's a tiny bit frustrating getting that 1024 tile and not being able to get it again"

WOUNDERFUL to play"
5,"April 4, 2014",‚ù§ I love this game. Its so hard but so fun. The only thing i dont like is how when you put 2 numbers together 1 pops up and sometimes that number that pops up is totally not the number you were hoping for but i love this game!

5,"January 3, 2016","Great game Great mind teaser,  easy to understand but no so easy to win! Good for concentration, keeps you thinking. Can put it down and come back to it without losing your progress,  great news!"
1,"April 22, 2014",Same old same old Don't devs know what the word original means any more. Blatant plagiarization seems to be the new app standard. Develop something original or don't bother.
5,"April 17, 2014", 2048 is a very addictive game. I found myself sliding numbered tiles around for an hour and a half the first time I played on a friend's phone. I downloaded it immediately! Not many pop ups. No crashes. Great game !

4,"April 3, 2014",Great pastime The game is not really explaining how or why but I'm trying to figure out do I need to multiply up to 2048 or the total 2048. I don't really get it. But its okay it passes the time in the waiting room
5,"April 1, 2014",2048 mania Amazing game. Such an addiction. Only 1 thing I'd like to know is I've beaten the score several times but just says restart nout has changed from what I can see. Love playing the game still though. :)

4,"May 9, 2014","Would be 5, but it seems mathematically impossible Would be 5, but it seems mathematically impossible. The board is too small has anyone gotten a 2048? My 10yo got a 1024, but the board fills up so you can't move. Great game, very addictive, just can't find the right strategy."
4,"April 7, 2014",Very Addictive Make an undo button and I'll give 5 stars. I play late in the night and when I'm in bed I tend to flick the blocks the wrong way and I need an undo please. Otherwise totally awesome and addictive!!
5,"April 18, 2014","Awesome Game!!!! I love that it's easy to play but difficult to figure out. It's addictive and frustrating but after trying many times, you stay to calm down and focus. on the goal. I give it a 10+10"
