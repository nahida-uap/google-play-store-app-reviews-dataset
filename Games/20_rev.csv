2,"October 21, 2014",Too small of a board! Most other 2048 games maximize space but instead on this one there's a small tile board and a lot of non-used white space on the sides and bottom. The tiles are too small and it strains the eyes. On top of which there's a lag on the animations. I'm just not impressed.

4,"May 21, 2014","Screen locks So far I am swirling for 4 days now. But the problem is that the screen locks after the set time (30s in my case). It would be nice to have the option to block the screen lock when autoplaying. Otherwise, the target for 8x8 seems easy, but I guess I'll find out in 4 more days or so."
4,"May 31, 2014","Loved it; recent issues As of today, every time I click on the app, it says the app has closed. I can't open it at all. I love this app, and I've been playing it for a few weeks now. I'd be pretty disappointed to lose the hours is progress I've made, and I probably wouldn't be willing to start over. Please fix this issue."
3,"June 1, 2014",Needs major fix This needs to be fixed so that the smallest tile increases its number as the top tile gets larger. It would literally take millions of titles otherwise and makes it impossible to lose. It's basically not a game.
5,"June 1, 2014","it soothes me. 8x8 grid. I have been playing this game as i go to sleep every night. sometimes I'm woken up by some status update going off and I see I'm still swiping. 65,536 32,768 That is where I am at. or set it to swirl and stare into the odd gravitational effect of the blocks compressing, it's like an optica...Full Review8x8 grid. I have been playing this game as i go to sleep every night. sometimes I'm woken up by some status update going off and I see I'm still swiping. 65,536 32,768 That is where I am at. or set it to swirl and stare into the odd gravitational effect of the blocks compressing, it's like an optical orgasm."
5,"May 20, 2014"," Has anyone won this yet? The amount of patents is ridiculous, if it wasn't for the auto play I don't think I would still be playing this. Do like this game a lot though"
2,"May 22, 2014","Works fine, but size removes challenge Increasing the board size this much removes any challenge for the game, and makes it a multi-hour war of attrition before you actually have to start thinking... This version works fine, but stick with one of the regular versions."
1,"May 20, 2014","Too easy Game is boring and repetitive with a board this large. No chance of losing, hours lost swiping mindlessly without even paying attention to it. Would not recommend. Mend, just play regular 2048"
5,"May 24, 2014","Super addicting I have been playing all day and only at 131,072 tile... Going to take a long time. For those of you who like a smaller board there is a setting within the game."
2,"May 30, 2014","Love the game, but........ I spent over an hour playing and saved it every couple moves. I went back to it and everything was gone. If it happens again, I'm uninstalling it! Please fix!"
4,"May 28, 2014",Fun! I was getting so frustrated that I couldn't get past 256. I only got there twice. Found this game and its so much more fun plus the game helps you out. They have an undo option. Its great! A Must Get :)
4,"May 24, 2014","Kill me now Yes, its much more of a marathon thsn a sprint like the original one, and it gas cost me my sanity, but this is as addictive as it gets ."
5,"May 23, 2014"," It definitely is a good way to kill some time. Ive been playing the same game for 3 weeks now and Im not even halfway through! Really fun, really addicting!"
4,"June 2, 2014","Very fun Also very power hungry, bring your power cord with you."
3,"June 3, 2014","Boring and tedious The game isnt fun anymore, the 8x8 grid is impossible to lose and you end up going on auto move the 4 million tile is all about waiting until auto move gets it for you. 3 stars"
4,"May 20, 2014","CRAZY !!!! This game is crazy. Yes, I mean crazy. I played it once - I mean I've been playing it since it was downloaded. It does not finish. I think I'm 15% done towards the end."
3,"May 21, 2014", The advertisements that appear in the bottom of the game dont let me pley. I cant see the bottom numbers that im forming
2,"May 31, 2014", Auto move is such a poor idea.  No talent people with high scores whatever
5,"May 18, 2014",Best Time killer I have a game going in HTML mode... How do l get it to work on the new default mode without switching to HTML every time i open it up?
5,"May 30, 2014","I love it At my current rate of playing, it will take me about a year to finish this game."
4,"May 22, 2014",Long game It might take you a year to reach the end of the game. That is a long time to invest and not get bored along the way.
5,"May 21, 2014",It's dumb That's why it's good.
5,"June 1, 2014",Good game It's a great game. It needs power ups and bonuses. Give me a power up that i can combine several numbers together in a line as long as they are in order.
5,"May 19, 2014",Great! Great strategy puzzle game! Keeps you busy and entertained in the most simple way. It makes you want to reach the highest score. It can be addictive.

5,"May 18, 2014",Excellent It is way better than 2048 cause the actual game is so frustrating But this game is excellent

5,"May 13, 2014","Awesome game! Yet very time consuming! I must be at +15 hours and only have a 64k tile! You should add a time counter, so you know how much time you've played. And maybe some stats, too (swipes per second, total up, down, L, R swipes, fastest 1024 tile, fastest 2048 tile, ec)"
4,"May 11, 2014","good, but.. When I plugged to charge my phone in playinh auto move mode, it sudden changed from corner mode to swirl mode…I tested this for several times and it still happened!!!!"
5,"May 13, 2014","Great game I have a 4,194,304 tile It's green!!  Took almost a month part time ... anyone else?  Would love multiple saved games so I can try other modes and not lose my 4 mil. Game. Thx Bo!"
4,"May 17, 2014","Great game I found this game very fun. However, can you create a mode where the lowest tile is say 32 or 64. Just to speed things up:P. Other than that. Awesome job creating this!"
3,"May 14, 2014","Interesting, but appears dull It' a totally new way of playing but the app looks dull like it was created in one night."
5,"May 13, 2014","Love this gamee Love this game, it's so addicting and time consuming, the only problem I have with  this version of the game..it NEVER ends."
4,"May 10, 2014","Can it save multiple games, though? I downloaded this, and would like to try these new modes, but I haven't finished my first game of it yet."
1,"May 10, 2014",Just an easier version of original. This is literally an Easier version of the original.  I could never get passed 512 on original got to 2048 on this version first try.
1,"May 13, 2014",I hate it It is really bad and I am not a hater.
1,"May 18, 2014", Game ended. Locked up. Too many moves. Only had 90 some thousand out of 4 million.
4,"May 15, 2014", Kinda cool how it does it for you  gets boring after breaking 2048
4,"May 10, 2014", Four stars because it does get boring after a while
3,"May 13, 2014",Uninstalls itself Every time i restart my phone the app uninstalls itself and loses all of my saved games on my Note 3
5,"May 14, 2014", I have the 131000 tile and still going at over 2 million points on day 7 THIS GAME IS ENDLESS!!!!
4,"May 11, 2014", I got bored with 2048 after I learned how to consistently win. Now I just like to run this on auto move.

5,"May 18, 2014", Cool
1,"May 7, 2014",Boring way to easy with all the room. And auto move wins for you. Took a good number game and made it pointless. The only challenge is trying to lose!
4,"May 8, 2014"," Good game, addictive but the target number keeps increasing every couple of days giving me false hope that I am near completion :/"
2,"May 7, 2014", This game never ends! I have  been playing for days and still on first game. This is for someone who has no life!
3,"May 6, 2014", The hardest thing about this game is trying to die. I just can't seem to do it.
1,"May 8, 2014", The game itself is slow to respond and then you need no life to play the game it takes so long to play
4,"May 9, 2014",Its good but ... Its a good game but even I find the 8x8 easy ( and I'm usually hopeless at this kind of game) I doubled the target and now just seeing how high I can go :)
2,"May 9, 2014",Bad game. It will say game over when all the grids are full but you could still combine a lot of numbers. What the f
1,"May 6, 2014","Boring! Swipe, Swipe, Swipe- repeat for another 10 hours."
5,"May 10, 2014",Yea Betta than original just more options and stuff
3,"May 9, 2014", Been playing for days and im still on my first game. I imagine in a couple of weeks it might get harder but only time will tell.
2,"May 9, 2014", The advertisements are blocking the bottom line of the grid
3,"May 7, 2014"," I've tried game and game again to complete the previous version, with a high score of 6000.  In this, I'm up to 100,000 and on still on my first game."
4,"May 8, 2014",Time killing I think 3x3 is harder
5,"May 7, 2014",Addict! I play this way to much!
4,"May 6, 2014","New target for 8x8 The new target for the 8x8 field is to easy, already got it doubled just with auto-move. Beside that, it's a gread version of 2048"

3,"May 4, 2014"," There's really not a challenge to a game if you can achieve your ""2048"" goal by swiping randomly, like I did. But if you challenge yourself to a minimum number of swipes it can be entertaining."

1,"May 4, 2014",Seriously Its dumb. If I wanted to waste my time and battery life for a dumb game I can find others. You dont have to do anything but swipe ur screen or put it on auto.  Dumb dumb dumb. I got a notice that the makers responded to this .  But dont see anything.
5,"May 5, 2014","Love numbers I think this is my new addiction.  I love numbers,  and this game is as slow or fast as you want it to be.  Fantastic!"
5,"May 4, 2014",Amazing The update is great and love the fact you dont have to get 2 billion anymore. That was impossible. Great game

1,"May 4, 2014","Umm what? It's just swiping around a box, nothing exciting just dull & boring.."
5,"May 4, 2014","Very well made Really like the extension off 2048 this game offers -- different grid sizes, modes, etc -- and also love how it continues to get updated."
4,"May 4, 2014", Mind numbing fun but there really is no point. Its a game you can't lose.
3,"May 3, 2014","Problems... The game is cool, but the grid is too small on my screen, and HTML5 has options ""new mode"" does not, and vice versa.   About screen: QR code? Make it a link. QR codes are for desktop websites which want a phone to scan it and go to the website. Not vice-versa."
5,"May 5, 2014","Kevvy Really to reach a minimum score of 50,000 just press the random swipe. It's no real challenge"
2,"May 4, 2014"," It works OK but without the constraint of the game design there is no challenge I got to over 700,000 on autoplay"
2,"May 4, 2014",Too easy ... Loved the challenge of the smaller grid version.  Unfortunately having a larger grid makes it just too easy.

3,"April 27, 2014",OK.... Would rate higher if there wasn't adds at the bottom. Makes it so I can't see the bottom of the screen. But all in all pretty good game.
4,"May 1, 2014",Easier than the normal Since you have more space here it is easier to achieve greater results.. For fun playing it is excellent but for challenge playing this is too easy and since it has more raws it is difficult to keep track with other movement but again well written and fun

5,"April 20, 2014",It's great. I don't know why people are voting this game so low. Maybe so they themselves can put out a copy. It pays great and it's really fun to see the autorun get up in the millions.
2,"April 21, 2014","Cool but The numbers keep disappearing. Like its flickering on and off the screen, making it impossible to play the game. Plus the options shouldnt be under the game board its disturbing the game itself"
4,"April 24, 2014",The best of its kind but Lags but don't know if it's just me (HTC one x) and does not properly save I lost my saved game of 300k+
3,"April 23, 2014","Very laggy, poor UI Slow response time, and poorly optimized for mobile. Swiping controls the game, but also swipes the screen. Good premise, but needs work."
1,"April 22, 2014"," It's fun, but swiping is not good. Take away the advertisement its  annoying.  I'll give 1 star for that."
3,"April 22, 2014","Sensitivity and animation The sensitivity needs to be much smoother and the animation needs to be smoother too. Right now both are giving me headaches. But awesome game, it just needs to be fixed. I'll be expecting lots of updates."
5,"April 15, 2014", This is awesome.. no words for it. Nevermind all the bad reviews just run it for 5 mins on auto and if you still dont like just uninstall it without hating cause for people like me this is like doing acid man...

5,"April 19, 2014", Is this a kind of joke?! Whatever it is ... it's just too fun! And stubed also I was playing one game for more than one hoar and finaly i get tired and came out! Nice
3,"April 17, 2014","Was good The game was fun and addicting. Draw back, after playing for awhile, I saved the game. Come back and there is no save and the high score is reset. Would be nice if the game signaled that it was saved."

2,"April 21, 2014","Laggy, not well designed. Swiping up causes the screen to jump, animations are choppy and laggy at best even on a quad core processor."
5,"April 24, 2014","Very nice game :) Don't agree with the bad ratings, this is well done and compared to the original 2048 really challenging.  Only downside here, would be nice if we could lock down the raster where the tiles move, accidentally swiping outside would scroll down.   Other than that- perfect."
1,"April 21, 2014",White screen It will not open its just a white screen. HELP ME
2,"April 26, 2014",Nowhere near as fun as the original I found this game quite pointless compared to the original. Takes ages to get to the point where there's any real skill required.

Please just do the maths before you give it a try and waste your lives. Kind of reminds me of old Red Alert hacks that gave you invincible nuke firing tanks. At first it sounds like it will be amusing but pretty soon you realise how pointless what you are doing actually is.

1,"April 26, 2014",Shite game There is a delay whenever you move a block and its way to slow Nowhere near as fun as the original
2,"April 26, 2014",Not good but not bad Ads interfere with the interface. Sorry but too laggy too.
1,"April 26, 2014",Lost work Cannot reload my work when start the game; lost all work...
4,"April 23, 2014",Fun but there is input lag The game is fun just like the original but it has some input last which is annoying (HTC one m8 here so it's not that the hardware is incapable)
5,"April 23, 2014","AMAZING!!!!! I love this app! You can play legitimately or use the buttons underneath the tiles. A little fun strategy I found out was to use swing until the screen is almost full, press stop, and then use swirl to compact it down into a corner. Great game! Definitely deserves more than 5 stars. :)"

This fundamental flaw and the laggy response of the app makes it a wholly unenjoyable experience."
2,"April 19, 2014"," This is freakin garbage, with some calculation you can see it will take 30 years of nonstop play to beat the game. Also there is no thinking involved you just slide the numbers around the board."
2,"April 16, 2014","Too slow The animation is way too slow considering how many swipes are involved. Turned on automove for a bit and then it took 3 minutes for the phone to stop and catch up. Also, instructions on automove would help as it doesn't show every move due to speed."
3,"April 25, 2014","Potential I agree with most comments. Like the original, this has great potential but the lag/delay makes for slow uninteresting and frustrating gameplay. I'll be back when/if patched."
2,"April 24, 2014","Slow and unresponsive Description says it's html5. It does seem like it's just the website embedded, not optimized for mobile, probably not a native Android app. Very slow and unresponsive (both the input and the screen refresh) to the point of being unplayable."
3,"April 24, 2014",Lag Everywhere Nice concept but on my HTC One X it lags too much.
1,"April 26, 2014"," Three times now, on the only three games I've started since I downloaded it earlier, in the middle of a move the screen has blanked and everything was lost. Gonna be hard to win that way."
1,"April 26, 2014","Bad Can yall update this game there are big ads at the bottom of the game and i can't see the numbers, and make the number a lil big so i can move the number!"
3,"April 24, 2014",Not too good Played in note 2 UI is not impressive plus the reaction time while moving the tiles is slow didn't enjoyed it much
5,"April 25, 2014",To the idiots who say it's impossible... I just beat the game. Along with the thousands of other people. Your mathematic skills are awful.
1,"April 25, 2014","HORRIBLE MODIFICATION I can't see the lower part of the game because of the ADS. Also, the blocks when tapped are too slow to respond. Poor modification of 2048."
1,"April 24, 2014",Ads get in the way. The ads are placed right in front of the bottom row of numbers. How am I supposed to play like that?

1,"April 20, 2014",Terrible interface When swiping you sometimes move the tiles (as expected) but sometimes you actually scrolls the page.
3,"April 23, 2014",Fun but won't save It has a save and load button but when you exit the app it won't keep the save. I love playing this game but with that there's no bringing me back.. please fix this issue

At one point I had 20 percent battery then 30 seconds later I was at 16 percent. Now it dropped the battery down to 12 before I could shut it down. It sucks don't get it it drains battery faster than it charges.
1,"May 2, 2014",worst app ever Doesnt load it stays white it isn't even 2048 its like 16 numbers long and when you get a a 5 digit number it freezes and has no undos and it lags really bad. Also makes do a 5 star rateimg before u can play word test app ever.
1,"May 4, 2014"," I dont whether it is just on my device or the actual game however its laggy, jumps and freezes.

Its way too easy and if I wanted to play it on a harder mode I may aswell just play the original.  I would seriously think about downloading this app however I would definitely download the original 2048 its super addictive and actually challenging."
2,"April 20, 2014","Nice idea But it's just jumping on the bandwagon a bit. Frame rate is low making it look very clunky, which is weird for a basic number game, and it obviously involves little strategy when the numbers are so high."
2,"April 21, 2014","Not good As the number of tiles is greater, it takes a long time to get to the hard part in the game. This causes the gameplay to be very tedious and tiresome. On top of this the game is not coded very well. There is a very noticeable input lag, and the design of the interface isn't very good."
3,"April 28, 2014",Where's my saved game? This extended version of 2048 was fun while it lasted.  But not only my score is lost. Thanks for the new update. Now I have got to start all over again...  But no. I won't. I've got better things to do.
4,"September 3, 2016"," Great way to kill time. I like the other boards and modes that give me a variety of options. In all seriousness though has anyone beaten the 8x8 board in classic mode.

Too many poor copy cats. I got this, honestly thinking it would be a bit more fun than the original because it's bigger. As it's so big, it ruins the point of getting to 2048 as it requires no skill. If the dev is going to copy a game, at least put your own turn on it, like design it differently etc. However, they haven't."
1,"April 25, 2014","Terrible. Didn't need to play more than 10 minutes of this to realise what a pile of rubbish this is. It's barely playable, there is no fluidity to it. Not even worth the download."
2,"April 21, 2014",Too easy to lose games After hours of playing (thankfully on auto mode) I lost all progress several times as it's too easy to touch the wrong spot.  There needs to be a double check before deleting.  Save button rarely worked.
3,"October 21, 2016",Too many ads! Its irritating! Please remove them! Then ill give 5 stars
2,"April 25, 2014",A very irritable issue You can't even properly move down without dragging the whole screen with you.
1,"April 24, 2014",Too bad copy Worst game... Too slow... Imitation also needs some innovation...
1,"April 23, 2014", Sucks. First of all like they all say its a copy and second its laggy on my phone and the normal onr doesn't lag. And some say it'll take forever to win which is true. I dont recommend this game to anyone except idiots.
2,"April 21, 2014",Unimaginative Fun game at first but not a challange after a while. I got to 4 million points with only the auto moves and it wasn't even close to failing.
5,"June 2, 2015","Great stress buster I just got the 1048576 combination, this game challenge my patience."
5,"October 25, 2014", New back up and restore feature was the one thing I'd wished for in earlier versions. This app is truly the ultimate one for 2048 fans.
4,"February 1, 2016",THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTIVE in a bad way
1,"April 23, 2014","Dum I hate this app. When I save it, it dose not save. I  tried to tell  my older sister my score and I forgot,so do not download because it is dum. By the way don't  say any thing mean because im only 9. If you download this app your stupid"
2,"April 17, 2014", Lags like gell. Unplayable. Good idea tho
2,"June 13, 2014",It's saddening. I installed this game once and got addicted. Then the game crashed and wouldn't open. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. After a few months the game crashed. I gave this game a second chance and it let me down. I'm going find a new game to play.
1,"April 23, 2014","Lost data I played this game for awhile, saved it, and came back to it, and my data was there. Then I did it again, and my save data was gone. It didn't even show a 'best' score. And considering you will never finish this game anyway, you really don't want to keep starting over every time you exit the app"

3,"April 27, 2014","Too easy, too slow. After getting the 8192 tile it became clear that I could spend another 5 weeks playing essentially the same approach before getting a tile higher than 32768."
1,"April 27, 2014"," There should be free codes available online for this game, yet there are ads on this version. As well, game is terribly unchallenging given larger number of tiles."
1,"April 22, 2014",Awful Takes way too long. If you swipe the side by accident you mess up or accidentally destroy the game that took too long to get where you were. Waste of time.
1,"April 26, 2014","Not good I uninstall it instantly, it lags in every swipe."
1,"April 27, 2014",This is not a game. All you do is put the automove on something and wait for your score to go up. There is no skill involved at all.
1,"May 4, 2014"," Bit boring,, takes the fun out of the game. Near put me to sleep"
1,"April 27, 2014","Horrible You sit there and let it autorun. But eventually, it just stops moving. Doesn't save, score doesn't go up, and a number of other bugs."
1,"April 23, 2014","Not great Cool idea, but very laggy, when you try to swipe it scrolls down, and it is impossible."
2,"April 29, 2014","Bad Its slow,  not very smooth and not original. Do not recommend,  just play the original its much, much better!"
2,"April 25, 2014", I like the game but it LAGS WAY TOO MUCH. I can do multiple moves before the first move goes
1,"April 24, 2014",Lag Would give 5 stars but there is a lag. Also when you pull down instead of combing the numbers downward you get the menu.
4,"April 24, 2014",Bit laggy s4 But fine to use
1,"April 24, 2014",Not good Very poor and slows down my phone alot! And the advertisements at the bottom limit your gameplay

2,"April 25, 2014", Everytime i came out of the game and went back i had lost the game and had to start again Very disappointed. Please fix
2,"April 25, 2014",Slow and laggy even on GS4 This is just one of those talentless hacks ripping from a decent Dev.
1,"April 25, 2014","Very poor Ads ads ads get in the way to the point where they hide tiles. Garbage, don't install"
1,"April 27, 2014",Horrible Update Not being able to save the progress now has made me restart and this game is stupid now
1,"April 24, 2014",More is not better. Ham-handed embiggening does the original no favors.  Also painfully slow.  Skip this brutish clone.
2,"April 24, 2014"," I don't like the design much and actually it's a bit hard to use, like with numbers the whole screen is moving..."

1,"April 27, 2014",Terrible Lost my progress when I had an 8192 box or something around that even though I pressed save....
3,"May 13, 2014"," Interesting additional features, but lags slightly (just enough to be very offputting) between swipe and animation, unlike the original"
1,"May 1, 2014", There are ads at the bottom of the screen and I can't see the entire box. Please fix this!
1,"April 21, 2014",Pointless There is literally no point to this game. Its impossible. Just play the real thing!

1,"April 21, 2014","Lag Like someone already said, tons of lag even on a quad core tablet"
1,"April 21, 2014",Novel Good concept needlessly extended. Without a working save-function this app is pointless.
2,"April 25, 2014",The save button doesnt work Played for almost an hour and it doesnt have a save option.

3,"July 20, 2014","More if I could see I like 2048, but 1/3 of the game was covered by ads. I clicked the ad to get it off and was still on there."
1,"April 22, 2014",Dont bother Fun game but it doesnt save your progress at all. It would take days of nonstop play to win. Dont waste your time.
1,"April 24, 2014",No. Just no. It's annoying and laggy and too much.
3,"June 7, 2014", Just lost interest in the game after I master it
