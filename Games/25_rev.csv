1,"July 7, 2017"," I have one word to describe the game. CLICKBAIT. Here's why: #1: Not available to change the colors. #2: Not available to change the board size. #3:  The 2 1/2 block didn't work. You need to fix all of it, then I'll change my rate."
5,"October 6, 2015","Please continue updating. This is an amazing Customizer Version of 2048, if it is just going to be left un-updated and stop in 2014, I'm going to be very sad. Really please continue this."

If I could be directed with careful instructions that even an idiot couldn't foul, then I'd greatly appreciate it and rate this a full 5 stars. Cheers for the mobile version though."
5,"February 18, 2017"," I absolutely love the interactivity that this game has to offer. Although I think the base number limit is high enough, I would appreciate it if you made it even higher. Other than that, I love this game."
5,"July 8, 2014","2048, but BETTER. This app takes 2048 to the next level by allowing you to do much, much more with the board, tiles, colors and more! Perfect for when you have nothing to do or just want to challenge your brain!"

5,"February 8, 2015","Amazing options Whoa this is a great addition to 2048, I'm surprised only a few ppl have downloaded it!"
