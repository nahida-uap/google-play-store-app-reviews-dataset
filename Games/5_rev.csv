5,"May 29, 2018"," I think I have downloaded this game on everything I can! When my tablet 
crashed and had to be fixed, 2048 was lost, so I decided to leave it off, 
BIG MISTAKE! It is quite addictive and is in the process of being 
downloaded now! I WILL NOT be without 2048 any longer!"
1,"April 8, 2018"," Uninstalled after reaching 16384. This is a silly game. Once you realize how to score, you either play with the undo, which turns you into an almost zero brain activity machine, or you don't play with the undo, in which case the game is insanely frustrating. Moreover, it can become too addictive."

should be very lucky to create 16k or 32k! Creating larger number is 
impractical but theoretically you can create up to 128k!"
4,"May 3, 2018"," I've been playing 5x5 mode. It's so much easier and the use of 5 undos 
makes it easier still. Kinda takes all the challenge away but it's a fun 
enough way to kill the time. I took 1 star off because it keeps asking me 
to rate it even though I already had."
5,"June 19, 2018"," It was so cool , I loved the game but after a while that I got a very good 
score at it , I wanted much more games and challenges but I understood that 
the game is over and there's no more levels ."

I like that it gives you a personal high score-- those have kind of fallen out of fashion over the years and I really miss them. Overall, it's a nice little time-killer if you're into it, but it's not for everybody. My advice? Try it out, play a couple rounds, and if you don't like it, toss it."
2,"December 25, 2017"," I launched the app when i got on the toilet in the morning, i was an hour late for work! I love/hate this addictive game!!"

4,"December 23, 2017", DONT INSTALL THE UPGRADE I rated this 5☆ originally.  I've downgraded it to 4☆ because the game play has been spoilt by adds and minor changes that have made it  less playable.

4,"November 2, 2017"," Would be better if you could undo more than one move, since it's easy to accidentally double tap and ruin a game.."

By the way if you are looking for a hack go on to the 8 by 8 grid and just keep doing this up, right, down and left. I got up to 4096 it's not that high of a number but you can go higher. For those people that just started  2048 is the number you get to before you win. I LOVE THIS GAME."
5,"August 8, 2017", I really like this game because it us very interesting and also very addicting. I find it a great game because you get to swipe and make bigger numbers from the ones that you start with. But the one downer about it is how you have to always make the same number as your biggest one so you can make it...Full ReviewI really like this game because it us very interesting and also very addicting. I find it a great game because you get to swipe and make bigger numbers from the ones that you start with. But the one downer about it is how you have to always make the same number as your biggest one so you can make it even bigger. I hope you like it as much as u do.
5,"October 7, 2017"," Er meh gerrd this game is goals!! I am so addicted to it i can sit there and be on my phone. My mom walks by, what are u doing? Me: Playing 2048. And i sit there for the next few hours playing it"
5,"June 7, 2017", Since most recent update it randomly hangs for a few seconds on 8x8 squares. By the time I have realised it hasnt swiped I am a swipe or 2 ahead and then it takes extra time to catch up again.

By the time I have realised it hasnt swiped I am a swipe or 2 ahead and then it takes extra time to catch up again. I was really enjoying it until this week - I especially liked the update that changed the above 2048 colours into the new range of blues/greens/purples.  Whateber was causing the issue was solved by a reinstall - thanks! 5*
5,"October 23, 2017", It's a great way to kill time! I absolutely love it! The only thing is that when you open it there is always that same stupid ad. But that's all. Overall it's great!
5,"June 27, 2017"," It's a very cool game, very addictive and entertaining but honestly it gets quite boring when playing bigger square grids. The developers can add something new to it."
5,"September 25, 2017", It's an amazing game!! I got over 2048 and on endless mode it keeps going and going which makes you're score really high the more you play - gonna go for a big score so I feel real good about this game -because it's wicked!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And yes - it really is addictive!!
4,"July 17, 2017", Had a lot of fun playing but 3x3 seems impossible just because 9 spaces isn't enough to for all the tiles you need to for 2048
5,"July 2, 2017", Thisnis a awsome game  it isvreally cool and It does not take long to doanload like most apps and dose no go slow
5,"October 18, 2017", Game is absolutely spectacular and not as easy as it appears the first time. Very engaging and addicting. I would like to see better graphics though!
4,"July 12, 2017"," I didn't understand how to play the game, at first now I do and I can not stop playing it."
5,"June 11, 2017", It's soo good for who don't want to put much pressure on brain. It's kinda timepass game but interesting n exciting
3,"July 2, 2017", It's fun to play but you lose quite easily and can't undo your move more than once which is bad.
5,"July 1, 2017"," It. Is. So. Adictive. I LOVE IT 😂😂 y'all should get this game👌 5/5, great  for ppl like me who like wasting there time on games like this👌👌👌😂"
5,"July 25, 2017", Amazing game. It is soooo addictive and so much fun. I have just finished primary school and we used to play it there
1,"July 13, 2017", I love this game and the app in general. I absolutely hate it when I go into the app and it blasts audio from an ad. Ads are fine. Blaring audio sucks.
5,"September 19, 2017"," Great that you can undo a move if it was just a slip of the finger. Wonderful game - you really have to think all the way through. I like to play for just a few minutes at a time, so I appreciate that the game is saved and waiting until the next time I feel like playing."
5,"July 15, 2017"," One of, if not THE, most addictive games I've ever played."
5,"June 29, 2017", Good over all and a grate thing for car rides my only thought was if you could win but i answerd that after a while
5,"October 4, 2017"," That it's a pain to be asked to rate something constantly.  It's a fun game, addictive, easy to play."
4,"June 23, 2017"," I quite like this game but it is tricky, not as easy as some."
5,"October 23, 2017", I usually delete games a couple of days after downloading because I get sick of them.  This is the one game I've had on my phone for years.
5,"September 27, 2017", This is a nice game for kids who don't really know much of counting by 2 4 8 and other. I like this game because  it has potential and fun to try to beat your high scores
5,"August 25, 2017"," It is an awesome game. I hate math, but love it. It's addicting, and will pass the time."
5,"July 26, 2017", I don't even know how to play thia game but I just keep clicking the scree...btw this is so fun to play :)
5,"June 12, 2017", This is one to keep going back to. Looks like nothing to play but try to keep making them combine...yes sir...not as easy as it looks.
5,"June 30, 2017"," 2048 is an excellent game. Ir challenges the mind, and it is also a great way to past the time."
5,"July 1, 2017", Better than the original. Great game and awesome app. The ads aren't annoying neither intrusive.
5,"August 19, 2017", This game is SO addictive and is very fun to play. It challenges your brain and it never gets old!!
1,"June 24, 2017", Might be the worst game I've ever seen. Even after reading instructions it makes no sense.
1,"October 28, 2017", The app keeps reducing my score once every unnecessary advert pops up.
3,"September 20, 2017", It's sometimes frustrating since its hard to know if you won or not
4,"August 3, 2017", Hard to see your score almost impossible to change which grid you are playing.
5,"July 21, 2017", I like the game because u can change the space and I like cuz its fun u should get this I was dieing without it
5,"October 26, 2017", Tooooo addicting. Playing the 8x8 board and you just keep going forever.
5,"June 20, 2017", Great way to pass the time.  Simple to play and requires little thought.  Something I can loose myself in.
4,"October 8, 2017", Hi I'm due to upgrade my phone soon is there a way I can transfer my current progress to the new phone I don't really want to start all over again
5,"June 25, 2017"," I loved it!! When you start paying it, its hard to stop!"
4,"June 7, 2017", I get busy in playing nd forget what's going around me
5,"August 2, 2017"," I love this game, it's addictive but doesn't make you want to throw your phone!"
4,"June 7, 2017", All's very well. Just one correction : A 3*3 grid can never result in 2048 - going by the math. So you may as well declare a player as a winner when he or she scores 512 in the 3*3 grid.
3,"October 12, 2017", Looooove the game BUT! HATE that there are so many adds
4,"September 24, 2017"," Game is fun and good exercise for the brain , but only change would be to make each number block a totally different color would make it easier to see quickly."
5,"September 9, 2017",Unbelivable Super i never finished the big one i got 2048
5,"August 28, 2017", I love it! It's so addicting and it's so fun. I go camping with my family and it's a good game to relax to.
5,"July 13, 2017"," This is a fun, addictive game. It's challenging and it requires at least a little brain power."
5,"October 20, 2017", I love this game it's the only game I have I play it all the time. My high score is over 15 million that is playing on the biggest board. I love to play this when I am relaxing!
3,"July 23, 2017", I use this game when im really really bored
5,"July 7, 2017", I loved it.. it made me rack my brain. Nice one I think u should add an opponent i.e. computer vs player.
4,"September 22, 2017", Helps my dyslexic son learn doubling of numbers
5,"June 7, 2017", It actually really fun and I didn't expect it to be so much fun
1,"October 4, 2017", Won't stop asking me to rate
5,"July 9, 2017", It's math only in evens like 2+2=4 4+4=8 on and on and its cool its leaning in a who l mother way
5,"August 8, 2017", Its a simple and yet a complex game enabling one to compete with oneself.. Best smart phone game I have ever played
5,"October 11, 2017"," Almost got 4096, addicted :("
2,"July 27, 2017"," I take it back. After I rated 5 stars, it still tells me to rate. Two stars because of addictivity."
3,"June 19, 2017", Too many ads interfere with the game
4,"August 22, 2017", Mind game and time consuming and addiction

5,"July 19, 2017", Annoyingly simple. Frustratingly hard
