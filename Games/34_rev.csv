I feel no shame in undoing such a move. My beef with this game is that there are CLEARLY players using cheats.  Look at the leader board: there are players in the top 3 who are Rookie (level 1) in 3rd place worldwide, with a score in the hundreds of millions, with no puzzle XP! How is that even possible?!  I'm pretty good at this and my high score is 2.5+ million."
1,"February 29, 2016","Grrrrrr I love the game, but now i need to get a new phone because the image of the game board is burned into my screen. Uninstalling. No, I'm not kidding. And as you can see, i said i love the game."
5,"May 4, 2016",I love this game! I like games that makes me! think hard and challenges me
3,"July 18, 2016", How can I put my profile picture

3,"December 4, 2015","Froze After several days of playing, got a score of 500000. Whew, great! But now I want to start a new game but it is frozen! I will lose my high score if I had to reinstall it. This happened once before. Needs fixed!"
1,"February 3, 2016","Too easy. I got 2048 in like, 5 minutes. And the game just keeps going there's no ending or any reward or... Anything at all for the matter."
5,"February 15, 2016","Excellent game Excellent game. There is though a problem with the leaderboard as the first 30 players, the ones over 1,000,000 points seem that they got the points from another game. Needs correcting please"
4,"February 24, 2016","My favorite endless game, but... I'll be replacing my phone soon and don't want to lose my progress, I don't have enough time or patience to start all over again and gain another 40+ million high score."
3,"September 1, 2015","Good and bad! Use it in two plataforms, on mobile works just fine, on tablet, gets unresponsive when moving numbers."
5,"November 10, 2015","Longest puzzle game ever This is the first puzzle game where a single round has lasted several hours played over 3 days and it's still far from over.  I'm at over 210,000 points and still going.  The swipe should be more responsive but I'm used to it now.  Much better than the 4x4 version, way less claustrophopic."
4,"November 21, 2015",2048 I like it because it is a lot of fun but at the same time it is very challenging.
5,"September 30, 2015",I love this app This app is really mind blowing game coz its compare with chess and other mind game..
1,"February 3, 2016","Login We're not told to login, until we die. I have only played one single game, and got almost 300k ... but then on exploring your buttons notice I have ZERO achievements ... because you didn't say we needed to log in :/ Not hanging around to find more stupid mistakes.
