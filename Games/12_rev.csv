5,"December 22, 2017"," Really great game! But mabye try putting holiday or just occasionally putting backgrounds to the game since the only thing around the part you play is just white, you should add themed backgrounds/themes! Love It!"
1,"January 12, 2018", What a load of rubbish god only knows how this game works. I saw so many great reviews so decided to try. Tip to you... Don't bother
4,"May 9, 2018"," Please move the start over button. I have hit that so many times when just 
trying to undo a move. At least add a confirmation popup"
5,"March 17, 2018", It's so fun and addictive!!  But the game is never ending if you use the 9x9 tiles haha thank you for such an awesome game!
2,"June 7, 2018"," I'm very sad with the fact that my game was blown due to the fact that 
clicking on settings buttom during the game leaves the game and just saves 
the actual score. Really, really sad. Unless you call retrieve my game, I'm 
gonna have this game removed from my phone."
1,"July 5, 2018"," I hit that after a lot of effort i clicked by mistake on reset and it 
immediately reseted the game It didn't show any message and i couldn't undo 
that. I would never play that again"
4,"April 22, 2018"," It's really fun to play but after a good while you get bored go to another 
game then come back to it"
3,"July 5, 2018"," Love the 2048 games, however this one seems a little glitchy, I push left 
and it goes right, up it goes down, left it goes up, you get what I'm 
saying. It works sometimes but not often enough"
5,"December 27, 2017", This game is very addicting  once you play your 1st time your mind will be stuck to it
