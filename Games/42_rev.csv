Minimal non-invasive ads for the companies own products when exiting the app, but hardly detracting from the experience. Two minor issues: Would be better if the ""No Ads"" statement was clearer for those of us that are more particular about this type of thing. Would also be nice if they had a ""Donate"" version, because I've paid for apps that I've spent FAR less time in."
5,"December 23, 2015","I love it Thankyou for the app, 1 sugestion, move the buttons to the top of the screen, I keep touching them by mistake, but it's not a biggie"
3,"July 26, 2016",Very nice but... Occasionally swipes will go the wrong way.
2,"March 22, 2017", Nice game but should have one chance undo option as many a times control go wrong and you have to start from beginning again
5,"November 12, 2015", I like this version because it has different colors past 128 and because the animation looks smoother.
5,"October 5, 2015","Ottimo Integrazione con play services, classifiche e grafica holo. Veramente perfetto!"
1,"November 20, 2015", it ALWAYS FREEZES every 5 seconds

3,"December 11, 2015","Is it possible to disable google+ integration? I love it, but I wish I could make it stop prompting me to integrate"
5,"November 6, 2015"," Beauti UI, best speed. Need 3x3, 5x5 mode"

5,"September 28, 2014","Perfect, and... Indeed, this is it - the supreme level of no lag in the field of hundreds and thousands of 2048 apps out there. The only thing missing is the latest Material design, but it is so good it feels material. :P"
5,"March 16, 2015",Perfection This app is much better than all of the other copies out there. The one thing that would make this better would be a theme/tile editor to personalize our boards.
5,"January 14, 2015","Best Variant I really like how smooth this game goes, positives everywhere ▒ Something that would be good for some people is a ""bold"" toggle, since I have shown the game to some people, but they don't like it because numbers are too thin"

5,"June 6, 2014","Looks amazing Colours are really nice, design is very up to date, and NO ADS!!"
5,"June 7, 2014", No ads = good
5,"May 26, 2014",The authoritative version as far as I'm concerned Looks great on my phone and tablet. I love the tweaks to sound and design that he made. Overall feels like a completely different game than the original.
4,"May 25, 2014","Looks great, but bug. I love the looks. Unfortunately there is a bug that makes the bricks move by themselves. Also it is very sensitive to swiping."
5,"May 25, 2014","Great Design I like design) how you made it! One of the best variant of this game) like it ))), but it has bug, sometimes it moves by it self to other side))"

5,"May 22, 2014","Simple yet challenging This a very good game to kill time. Very easy to pick up and learn, but don't be fooled--it is a challenge! The app itself is also stable."
5,"May 18, 2014","Fun game, too bad I can't beat it Thought that's on me, not the developer :) Well-designed, ad-free, etc. Recommended."
4,"May 18, 2014"," Amazingly done, if just the animation glitch when you play the last step is fixed it would be perfect! Could you also remove the rotation?"
5,"May 22, 2014",Just a little bit more Lags a bit when doing multiple combos. Mostly caused by the sound. There should be an option to disable sound.
5,"May 20, 2014"," It's 2048, and it doesn't ask for any permissions."
5,"May 18, 2014",Amazing I like it really much its like the more holofied version of the game which is amazing

5,"May 18, 2014","Lovely ui, great game Beautiful UI, and the app settings now stick."
5,"May 15, 2014"," Best of its kind, however, the settings don't stick. I want the dark theme all the time. I don't want to keep selecting it."
4,"May 15, 2014","A good game Otherwise great, but the settings don't stick. I have to deselect immersive mode again and again every time I start the game."
5,"May 15, 2014",Great 2.0 update The dark theme looks great and is nice for when I'm playing at night in a dark room.
5,"May 15, 2014","Excellent Version Clean, simple, and concise. Definitely the best version of this game I've tried."
4,"May 16, 2014","Sleek holo design Nearly perfect, animation seems a bit stiff"
5,"May 14, 2014",Nice app Can't get my hands off this game in free time.. lol
4,"April 27, 2014", The only gripe I have about this version of 2048 is that it can input 2 commands at once. It can mess me up. Basically it's a little bit too responsive. One action at a time please.   Otherwise great skin. Maybe more skins.
5,"May 4, 2014","Best 2048 out there. No ads, Play integration, sexy looking, fluid, Googly designed, no permissions, immersive mode; seriously you can't ask for more. Great developer."
4,"April 28, 2014","Nice UI I like the UI better on this app more than other ones on the play store.  Dev responds quickly which is awesome. Would like to see maybe a dark theme, might be cool."
5,"April 28, 2014",No permissions. No problems. Fun and addictive. Best 2048 game out there. Must download. Edit: updated and everything seems great as always. Running just fine. Still suggest you download this!
5,"May 6, 2014","Amazing and Nice Display This is the most addicting game ever and the fact that it's a better remake than the original app is even better. I LOVE the display and I would recommend this particular app to everybody I can find. Download this app! It's worth it, yo."
5,"April 28, 2014",Can't get better! This is a perfect copy of 2048 with the best UI and feature set. It's beautiful.
2,"May 11, 2014","Glitchy! Good looking game but many times if I swipe up, it will move up and then right automatically."
3,"May 13, 2014",It is a well designed one but... The game sometimes automatically moves the boxes from left to right. It ruins the game. Devs check the code pls
5,"April 29, 2014","Perfect app No permissions and ads, just pure fun. Job well done by developer."
5,"April 28, 2014",Fantastic Still addicted after a month of playing! Far superior to threes.

4,"April 24, 2014","Beauty is in the eye of the beholder I personally find the look of the app to be rather harsh and featureless, but it is the only version of 2048 I've found with Play Games integration, so it makes up for it in that."
4,"April 20, 2014","Great app but... Has some graphical glitches. Not sure if it's just the app responding too quick to gestures but if it, recommend some delay, maybe 0.5 secs, before reading the next move..."
5,"April 25, 2014",Great This is the best 2048 game I've tried so far. It's really well designed. I actually would like to see ads added to this game if it means the developer gets some incentive to make more games for us!

First of all the game looks so tiny on it because the playable part of the screen is small compared to the full screen size of the app.  Second of all. It doesn't respond to the touch!! sometimes it goes up and down after a few tries, but never sideways. of course that makes it useless. It works well on my Nexus 7, but I would really like having it on my crappy phone. Thanks in advance"
3,"April 27, 2014","Beautiful design but some issues Block transitions could be smoother,  annoying when pulling up or down from immersive mode and moving the tiles"
5,"April 15, 2014",Best 2048 app hands down. No permissions. Achievements. Holo design. Dev has done a good job differentiating from all the other clones.
5,"April 20, 2014","Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8 Smooth, beautiful, and no ads. However I would like an option to turn off immersive mode, as its nice to have my status bar on screen. Also a night mode would be great. :)"

5,"April 21, 2014","Clean UI, great game. Simple UI that is easy to look at and navigate. Nothing stupid and flashy like most games. I'm using an GS3 and having no problems whatsoever!"
4,"April 19, 2014","No permissions (b^^)b Aside from small graphical glitches and a missing auditory clue for sliding without merging (for blind play), all this tiny (yay) version really needs to be a winner is a catchy background tune."
3,"April 23, 2014","Random moves Does random moves sometimes without me touching the screen, looks great and nice to have no permissions"
5,"April 15, 2014",Super Simple and Beautiful Best job of bringing 2048 to Android that I've seen.

Meaning it always starts with the navigation bar and the notification bar transparents, instead of in full immersion mode as it should. I'd change the toggle button for a pause button. It's more intuitive and gives more freedom to the gamer so he/she can multitask without worrying about any missed moves. Oh... And I still think you should replace the main app icon!
