2,"December 4, 2017", Was a good game until the ads were changed. The full screen ads pop up with no warning and are too easy to click when trying to interact with the game. Uninstalling.
5,"May 4, 2018"," Addicted. Playing for years. Everything is at its best except advertisement 
part!"
3,"January 9, 2018"," Was 5 stars, addition of full screen ads drops it to 3. Poorly done devs."
5,"March 1, 2018", This game without undo is great its more challenging even thoughg if you made a mistake it could ruin the whole game
5,"May 17, 2018"," Best game ever... only one issue: WHERE IS THE PVP!? If you put it on the 
achievements, you should make it available."
5,"November 21, 2017"," Thanks for replying, I been playing this game for years. By the way, thank you again to fixing the game by an update."
5,"March 20, 2018"," Love the extra modes like survival, how smoothly the games runs, the ability to play on bigger boards and night mode. The background music is very distinctive; I think it works well. Thumbs up for the best version I've found!"
5,"January 10, 2018"," This has night view with dark background, exactly what I look for in all games. A well executed game app!"
2,"December 26, 2017", Favorite game until they ruined it by changing playing screen that is now distracting with larger ad. Destroyed playing experience. Deleting after this review.
1,"May 13, 2018"," I don't mind ads. I don't mind popups from time to time, but popups with 
the sound on is unacceptable."
1,"January 31, 2018", The ads are terrible now and the playing experience is ruined. Uninstall.
3,"November 21, 2017", I love this game but now the ads appear at the bottom and they cover part of the board. It doesn't help because I'm concentrating more to not look at the flashing ad instead of playing
5,"November 22, 2017", Great way to pass the time on a sick day. Just what I needed.😊
5,"December 18, 2017", Love this game...love that its math and it's really addicting

If you ""pause"" the game, the random numbers and location become impossible to win. I don't have hours to play at a time. But if I play 5 minutes and come back I lose in like 2 minutes."
1,"February 1, 2015",Too many hackers I use to love this game because of the multiplayer but recently i noticed too many hackers.  They'll earn points so fast and one player had 66000 right away and one has 21000 in the beginning of the game. I'll change my rating when it get fixed.

5,"February 28, 2015",Loved it! I just loved this game!. And I have completed the game and got 2048! What I didn't know that the game can continue even after a person gets to 2048 tile which is nice but strange too. But keeping that aside it's must game.
5,"May 9, 2016",Got 2048 I did it . after a while but got it finally. But need some reward after achieving it. Game says please continue playing
5,"August 1, 2016","Better than Pokemon Go! Warning: This game can be addictive. If you get frustrated with the 4x4 mode switch to 5x5, it is much easier to get 2048."
4,"December 22, 2014",I love it but... It gets boring if u keep not getting the number 2048 but overall I liked it

4,"October 29, 2015",Excellent but....... This game is awesome but the problem with this is there is no undo button....... Because sometimes u make a wrong move by mistake n that finishes the game!

The fundamental concept of this game is flawed too. When you develop the skill, it comes down to luck of the draw if the computer places a block in a bad place, forcing you to disrupt a pattern. From then only a few moves and its game over. Thus, beyond a basic level, there is NO SKILL TO THIS GAME, it is purely random. the only use this game has is passing time..."
3,"January 23, 2015","Nice game, but too much advertisement! It has became annoying!"

5,"October 30, 2016",Addictive I love the game and it is not lagging or slow so it's really helpful. This game is so addictive and fun to play as i used to play the mini games of this on the talking tom game section I am now obsessed with the game!

1,"December 18, 2015",Irritating adverts The adverts lock out the app. They spoil what is a good underlying app. Just about to uninstall.

4,"March 19, 2015",Achievements don't work I downloaded the game to increase my score but achievements don't work properly. They don't show up even when I do what is said. Addictive anyway. Fix this and I'll give 5 stars.
