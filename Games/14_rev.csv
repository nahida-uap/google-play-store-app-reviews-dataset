5,"August 9, 2017"," 0Nice game, but a lot of sh!ty ads and asking obsessively for rating  Update 10/08/2017 Regarding the answer from developer: guys, are you broken or something? You keep posting the same answer / reply to all ratings. Do you have a monkey there who's doing copy / paste?"
5,"February 27, 2018", This game is great.  I need to get out of my head sometimes and just enjoy myself.  This game helps me do both.  I play pretty quickly and don't think too far in advance.  It has given me hours and hours of enjoyment.
3,"September 23, 2017", Great game. Annoyingly asks for ratings after each game. You're rated now. Let's see if this begging will end
4,"April 15, 2018"," I really like the game; however, I find the numbers floating around in the 
background very distracting and hurts my eyes. I may have to uninstall 
because of this. Is there a way to calm the background down?"
2,"November 22, 2017", Wouldn't you prefer an honest review?Automatically loses stars because it specifically asks for a five star rating. Adequate 2048 game. Not outstanding
3,"August 27, 2017"," Better graphics than most, however, the sound needs some change. I have played similar games, that have a slight increase in ring tone, w/ each higher pairing (& l loved it; very gratifing!).

I have played similar games, that have a slight increase in ring tone, w/ each higher pairing (& l loved it; very gratifing!). Also, to me @least, the tones in this game are nerve grating...perhaps, the type of tones used are too echoing, as well as, high in pitch?  Improve the ringing, then you'll have your 5 star.  Still, well done!"
2,"October 9, 2017", Dont like horrible sounds it makes its a migraine waiting to happen and thought it was a diff one when downloaded it one i wanted gives me a undo button for mistakes
1,"January 21, 2018", I've been noticing the reviews and everytime someone rates the game even if it's bad they put the same text for me im I'm deleting this and getting a different version
