5,"June 20, 2018"," Loved the original 5x5 square. This gives you the choice of long or short 
games and it saves your progress. There are adverts but they're a little 
strip at the bottom and aren't annoying."

enjoy it"

bit... I turned off all other apps, but 2048 extreme was still slow. Then 
it started jerking commands that I didn't do... going wrong directions and 
playing multiple turns instantly, so I couldn't go back to where I was. I 
love the 10x10 concept, it's just a shame that the game won't play properly 
otherwise I wouldn't have deleted it. Ps, using a s5"
4,"May 27, 2018"," the game slows down in the new update after playing for like five minutes 
.... and it screwed up my game because at some points it just goes on any 
direction it wants😐😐"
5,"May 24, 2018", I want to add 524288 + 524288 Requesting you to update the game
5,"June 13, 2018"," Challenging but not stressful. Can start and stop and restart at anytime. 
Perfect for a quick break game."
3,"June 9, 2018", Does this game ever end? No strategy just a time waster.
5,"May 22, 2018", Nice
4,"May 17, 2018", Love this game because it helps your brain
4,"May 10, 2018", Change the colour

1,"March 27, 2018"," I'm going to file this under ""games made far easier by expanding them"". This loses sight of the point of the original game."
5,"February 13, 2018"," Was working great, had 18000 something. Then the game just closed me out, not happy about that."
5,"January 27, 2018"," I guess this is what you do when you get really bored. I'm not trying to win,  with the 10x10 I'm trying to loose"
1,"January 8, 2018"," Win on large in about 5 minutes, said click to continue. Clicking did nothing, game locked up at that point, can't progress anywhere."
5,"December 16, 2017", It's so addicting and I played till I got 16384 my arm actually hurts😞
5,"December 16, 2017", Its fun when you just want to sit and relax. It's realy good
5,"February 16, 2018"," When you need something to distract you completely and Absorb you without it being taxing, this is it. Love it"
5,"January 25, 2018", I like the game but can you add more color to it or make your own one like GREEN THE BEST COLOR😎💚🎮
4,"February 1, 2018"," A great variation on an old favorite, simple graphics and unobtrusive advertising."
5,"March 30, 2018", It's good. I like it. The pop up notifications don't have a way to be shut off which isn't cool though.
