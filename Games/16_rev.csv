I do this because I don't want my phone making unexpected sounds so people look at me funny. Static ads, I sit through. It's pretty simple really, if you want me to see the ad, and possibly go for the product, don't use video ads on a mobile game."
5,"August 1, 2017"," Great app pass time away.  Adds though are a pain when full screen and noisy and and often lasting 15 to 20 seconds interrupts and stops my music playing.  Paid 55 pence and not getting add now, it's well worth it"
5,"April 17, 2016","Don't want ads? I haven't tried the app, but I'm noticing that a lot of people aren't too crazy about the ads. Simply turn off the Wifi, so that the app cant retrieve the ads from the Internet. I hope this helps you solve the problem with the ads."
2,"July 9, 2016"," Was my favorite 2048 for a while. The ads are not usually intrusive so i didn't mind. However, just then i got an unskippable 12 second video, so I've uninstalled it. If you ever decide to remove the video ads (waste of my limited data!) then feel free to let me know."
2,"January 8, 2016",Reached the 2048 tile twice yet it doesn't go to the next level. Doesnot even Congratulate me on reaching my target. I am disappointed
2,"March 10, 2016","Okay game but plays loud video ads Loud video ads occasionally okay between games. These can not be skipped, closed or muted."
5,"September 18, 2016", Finally got to 2048 after two yeats! Love the game though!       Also anyway for the dev to clean up the leather board? Way too many cheaters
5,"February 10, 2016","Ruining my life Even tho I've mastered it to the point of getting 4096 multiple times, I'm obsessed with playing it any airfare moment. Master the use of the Undo allowance for great success!"
5,"September 11, 2016","Need to escape boredom? This game frustrates me and challenges me, easy game to play, hard to win. Something fun to play at 2am when you have nothing else to do"
5,"July 20, 2016",... Sorry for the lame rate. I must get back to the game. In already taking to long as it is. Addiction. Creating.  Somebody get help!
5,"February 9, 2016","Great time passing game I've had the game for a couple years now and I've never known there were ads until I read some of the reviews, and it wasn't until I used the reset button that I found the ads.           10/10 would play more."
4,"July 28, 2016","Fun Great game, but the ads need to honor the no sound setting. The new videos can be pretty loud especially when you don't expect it."
5,"January 30, 2016",Gf tricked me She said I'd get a kiss if I got a higher score than her. I did. She didn't. I cried. She left. Good game though! I have a lot of time to play it now...
2,"April 29, 2017"," I would rate this higher, but they recently changed how they do ads. Now periodically you get a video ad with the volume on. No longer can you play a quiet game without turning the sound down."
4,"February 15, 2016",Good game to kill time. Great game to play while you are waiting for something or nothing to do. It's a great game for killing time. And addictive too. But ads are very irritating.
2,"April 6, 2016","Great app, super annoying ads The ads interrupt background books on tape, podcasts, or music, which then do not automatically resume when 15 second ad is over."
5,"January 14, 2016","Simple and clean. The game is simple to play, but difficult to master. The colors make matching easy and relaxing, without being glaring.  What I find even more appealing is that the game isn't swarmed with advertisements, like so many others."
1,"February 24, 2017", The ads are very intrusive. A loud video would start playing at the end of the game. Will never install anything promoted in such an annoying way.
1,"February 14, 2016","Ads ads ads Love the game, HATE the video ads! Static ads are fine, but these loud video ads are just ridiculous! I can sssure you these ads are 100% ineffective!!!!!"
1,"September 15, 2016",Really annoying Was my favorite game until the adv happened
1,"January 2, 2016",Rip off. Total rip off of the original game Threes. At best a cheap imitation of what is a good game. You can just swipe wildly and feel like a winner.
3,"March 3, 2016","Undo after game end The game is a good challenge, and is great for killing time. The only thing that would compel me to give it 5 stars would be the ability to use the undo funcrion after I've 'failed'."
2,"October 30, 2017"," I just rediscovered this game again after a really long layover, and came back to ads with audio that I can't mute. Come on! I can't have Greg Olsen's voice blasting from the bathroom stall talking about shampoo"
5,"December 30, 2015",It's a really good game I've played this game for 1 or 2 years its fun but then sometimes you get bored of just playing the same game.
5,"February 4, 2016",Best math game ever I try to go to sleep but it is hard for me so I gust play this game
3,"February 22, 2016",Warning...  Video adds Game is great.  Video ads are a pain in the butt.  Waste of mobile bandwidth.
4,"December 27, 2016","Addictive Highly recommend the app, but the ads are annoying as ****. There should be an option  (paying?) to turn them off."
5,"January 26, 2016",Addicting Playing this game can take up entirely too much of my time. It's good for just a few minutes all the way up to a half hour.
3,"August 24, 2016",Nothing special Pretty mind numbing.  Not much I can say about this.  Can use it to kill maybe 10 minutes
5,"May 25, 2016","Addictive 2048 is a very interesting game and it is so hard to stop playing, after your first and multiple trys of playing the game!!!!! If you don't have this game downloaded yet, you just don't know what you are missing out on!!!!!!! üòäüòâüòÜ"
4,"February 5, 2016","Love the game I love this game, but I hate that the ads auto play sound.  So annoying!"

5,"August 11, 2016","Cool app No annoying ads every now and then, doesn't hang, pretty neat."
1,"January 16, 2016","Terrible intrusive ads Ads are bad enough, loud ads that can easily be silenced or dismissed are unforgivable."
5,"June 8, 2016","Causing phone to crash Was perfect until my phone started crashing because of it, had to uninstall"
3,"December 21, 2016",Why the 4's? Why must the game spawn 4's? It constantly wrecks my games and goes against the entire is of the game. Can you please make it stop?!
1,"June 21, 2016",Screw notifications It pinged me a few times to play some more or share my achievements to the world via social media.  Inventor of game notifications on your cell phone should be shot.  Uninstalled for using notifications.
4,"January 29, 2016",Decent time killer Fun and quick. Ads are loud anf annoying. Hello airplane mode
5,"April 3, 2018", I am hooked on this game since day one (4 years ago). The only problem is with the undo counter. Very often it shows me a non-zero value but still does not provide an undo. Cheers ü§ì
3,"July 15, 2016","Its good I can't get it mastered yet, and its way to hard so I have uninstalled it."
3,"November 20, 2017", It needs to be multiplayer or two player so I can defeat my cousin I asked him how many one-a-day vitamins do I take he said 15 they're one-a-day vitamins why would I take 15
2,"October 1, 2017"," I used to like this until they added the LOUD ads. The first time, it startled me and I nearly dropped my phone. No more starting a new game discreetly."
4,"November 14, 2016",Well this is the best I love this game but this version is sad and boring. I would like some music.üé∂

5,"July 15, 2016",Addicted to it Very addictive. I have been playing since yesterday.
5,"June 24, 2016",Addictive Learn the trick...warning spoiler alert.....read on to learn the trick....always try and keep highest number in one corner...and just play so you never trap a 2 or 4 with out the ability to match it with another 2 or 4.
5,"February 19, 2016",Addictive and fun Keep me to play it again and fill boring also waiting timeüëç
3,"December 6, 2016","Fun game, once was a challenge, now I easily beat it I came back to play it, and it is very easy, understanding the system gets boring."
4,"April 1, 2017", VERY addictive once you get the hang of it. Only suggestion for improvement would be to have players high score sync to their Google account. I've got three devices with this game on them and each with a different high score:/
5,"September 4, 2016",It's a bit like the economy Random numbers moving around the screen. Getting bigger and bigger then getting stuck...like EU economy...end of game. New game - post Brexit...2+2 is 4...boom and bust.
1,"July 31, 2016","Was my preferred version Then it updated itself without my permission(thanks google), now it has ads, achievements that don't work, and it takes up too much space. I'm uninstalling. Rip my highscore."
3,"June 24, 2017"," The combination animation is quite choppy. Other than that, good game."
2,"March 14, 2016",Heavy advert 15sec played advert after game.  Extremely annoying plus can't turn volume off on advert so can only play in private.
2,"August 10, 2017"," I rated this higher before they started adding ads with sound. Game is a great time killer and brain teaser, but if you pull it out at work make sure it is on mute! A silent game should have silent ads."
4,"May 21, 2018", The game is good. Keeps me going when I am bored :)
1,"January 22, 2018"," Loud video ads killed this game. Unskippable, loud, intrusive and extremely annoying. I don't mind paying for a game, and I don't mind ads. I do mind loud blaring noise. Pity"
1,"December 26, 2015",Dum Wen im in a game I lag out its hard wen it lags out the numbers don't move
2,"April 11, 2017", Obnoxious ads now. Take over your phone and play sound and pause any podcast or music on in the background.
5,"September 10, 2016","Challenging and fun Love this game! One player, so I don't have to wait around for it to be my turn, yet competitive because you can Compare scores with friends."

5,"May 23, 2016"," Good way to kill time when sitting in a waiting room, but getting incredibly high scores can take a deceptively long time."
1,"July 26, 2017", The way the numbers appear is very obstructive and least helpful and user unfriendly
1,"July 2, 2017", Changed from a 5 to a 1 because of video ads becoming the norm.

The problem is the video ads will chew through my data plan the more I play it and that is not good. Several apps I use have gone to the video commercials and it sucks for two reasons. First it burns mobile data allotments and secondly the sound is intrusive. This would be a 4 or 5 star review if not for the video.
5,"November 21, 2015","Utterly addictive I never get tired of playing this game. That's bad news for getting other stuff done, but it's perfect for any time I need a distraction during a long wait."
5,"November 13, 2015","Hate ads sry I enjoyed the game till ads pop up after finishing a game. I'm really sry cuz I liked this game. I know that nothing is free in this world and I know u have to live from something, but I don't like this as a way to do it. GL   EDIT: THX FOR HEARING CUSTOMER NEEDS"
5,"November 5, 2015","Big buttons, fun to play This is the second app I am trying for the same game. Big buttons for numbers are really good to play. The app by original developer had small buttons and was also heating in Nexus 5 maybe bcoz of html app design. This app does not have those problems."
5,"December 10, 2015","I just beat it! Got addicted months ago but just Figured out the  strategy to win today and after an hour of perfecting my technique I won. No big bang or glitter, that sucked.. Its extremely hard without the  strategy. Now it's just about patience and making the right moves."
1,"November 12, 2015",App freezes up After I run out of moves I close the game. Then when reopen it I'm stuck on the screen with no moves left and no way to reset. I have to clear cash and data to get the game to work again but that deletes my top scores.
1,"October 28, 2015","Ridiculous Ads The app now plays a 15-second ad in between every game, overriding my music app and killing the mood. I'll be looking for a different version now."
4,"November 3, 2015","Intrusive ads damage app experience This is a great, fun puzzle game. I find it really relaxing to sit and play quietly,  almost meditatively... Right up until the game ends and an ad starts blasting my eardrums and ruining my Zen thing. Please start video ads out muted, or have the user press a button to play the ad."
2,"November 4, 2015",Annoying adds Great game but after every round annoying adds (including videos ) pop up. Will find same game with less adds )))
4,"December 13, 2015","Works well, what you'd expect The app works well, gives exactly what you'd expect from a 2048 game. The video ads between games can be annoying, but there are no other ads."
4,"October 18, 2015",Lots of fun I play this game when in trying to pass time or otherwise occupy my time. It's fun.  the video ads are super obnoxious. The video ads and very occasional graphics slowdown are the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars.
4,"November 25, 2015",Great game ... but beware the Video ads A great simple quiet game that you can pick up any time ... as long as you turn the sound off on your phone before the game ends. The game runs smoothly but the video ads at the end  are a real pain!
1,"December 3, 2015","Video ads Perfect addictive game, but last update brought loud video ads. I don't know if it was the update or not, but  these ads can not be skipped or canceled with back button. So goodbye."
1,"October 27, 2015",Forced ads = uninstall They recently added video ads that you must watch a portion of before you start a new game. I don't mind a simple ad I can see and close but forcing someone to watch a video ad is crossing a line.
1,"October 21, 2015","Forced video ads. I enjoyed this game for a long time, but the ad format has recently changed static pop-ups you could easily dismiss between games to forced, fifteen second long video ads.  Intolerable."
5,"November 25, 2015","Ads aren't that bad people. The ads only pop up after you play a game, not during it. They are easily dismissed as well. As for the game it is fun and addictive. Very well done on the developers part."
4,"November 3, 2015","Addictive as crack Great game, but annoying ads. But the bills got to get paid somehow..."

5,"October 28, 2015","It really is addicting You know, at first I couldn't figure it out, but I finally put 2 and 2 together!                                             That was a bad one wasn't it"

4,"December 1, 2015",Addicting and frustrating. Very frustrating at first then you learn patterns now 2048 doesn't seem far away.
5,"October 30, 2015","Great game This game is a fantastic way to pass the time. Between classes, waiting for a meeting, etc. If it didn't have ads, I would use it more."
4,"November 15, 2015","Pretty cool. I wish the interface was a bit better, but I understand why it isn't. However game play is fluid and I love the simplicity of it. Also, the awards seem to be right on the money."

2,"December 9, 2015","Video ads use mobile data when off WiFi Video ads play even when you're off WiFi, using your mobile data - not acceptable."
5,"November 25, 2015","One of the best Logic games I have played. It is good because when I need a challenge, I think about it, then I think about games, then logic game, soon eventually leading up to this game. P.S. Will you realease the Fibonacci version of this game?"
3,"November 12, 2015",Great fun Very enjoyable puzzler game. The ads are annoying.
2,"November 27, 2015","Loud ads I've disabled sound, yet the app insists on playing loud video ads. Shame."
3,"October 17, 2015","For unlock Must rate for Unlock achivments, In my opinion it's not good."
3,"October 26, 2015",Finish it to quickly I beat the score of 2048 to quickly add another level when you have to get a higher number but it's good because it's a good game to play on a long trip and there's no adds
4,"November 26, 2015","The best 2048 out there! Simple, neat, all necessary features included. Got exactly what I came for. (-1 star for not crediting the original author.)"
4,"November 8, 2015","Good Its good but the game is hanging. It is very slow ,some bug issue"
3,"October 18, 2015","Games great once you block the ads. It's great having a rooted device.  All the fun and none of the ads bull. In all honesty, there is no difference between this and any other version of 2048.  They're all copies/clones of each other."
