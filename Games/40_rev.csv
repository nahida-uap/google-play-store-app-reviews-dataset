1,"April 12, 2018", So many ads you can't make 2 moves without an ad popping up.  And even worse you have to sit through part of the ad because it's the ones with the fast forward button that loads before you can exit he ad. Whoever came up with that type of as should be shot . Other than that coughs be able cool game
5,"April 15, 2018", Love the game but way to many ads.  Seems like you have to watch a 30 sec ad for every 10 moves.  It is a bit excessive. I going going to delete the game
5,"April 7, 2018", In the beginning it was eh cuz I didn't know how to play you know I do know how to play and my score went through the roof 20000 + points just on the second game
3,"March 27, 2018", This game is addictive the only down fall is the adds every two mins for 30 seconds its that annoying it makes me want to stop playing and delete the game
5,"March 23, 2018", Add are horrible.  I paid to get rid of the ass and they are still there.

1,"October 2, 2017"," Forced ads extremely often. They make it so it runs to an ad the instant before you tap so that you're forced to clock on the ad. Otherwise, I love the game. One of a kind and a great way to relax"
