2,"November 14, 2017"," I won the fisr time I played.  It is too easy. And my finger got tired!  Change it to use the tilt sensor instead of swiping, and fire the balls in on an increasingly fast timer, and you might have something fun."

Oddly enough I found something to help me sleep, strange it turned out to be a game of falling balls.. Anywho... Good for sleep... Other than that not sure there is much of a point..."
2,"March 2, 2017"," I liked the idea when I saw it in the shop, thought that may be a new challenge even harder than the square 2048. I really hoped it to be good.

I really hoped it to be good. But sadly it's no challenge at all, I got the 2048 on the second try, you simply need to push in the same direction all the time and occasionally need to rattle the board around a lil to connect the really big balls but it's sadly far to easy to be any fun."
5,"November 23, 2016","Better & Different A circle of balls, with numbers, that swirl & bounce around. There is nothing like this - not 3D, Circular, Hexagons, Chemistry, letters, foreign symbols, et cetera. I have played them all. or I Thought I had anyway. This is superb."
2,"February 28, 2017", Want a game that wastes your time? Look no further! 98% of players say they wish they never took the time to download it!
4,"December 28, 2016","Creative and updated i think this version is excellent!  i played the basic 2048 for a while, loved it then got bored of it. i found this and think its very creative, although i found it to be much easier. so i'm tied between the challenge and setting of it, either way both versions are fantastic! a great way to pass by...Full Reviewi think this version is excellent!  i played the basic 2048 for a while, loved it then got bored of it. i found this and think its very creative, although i found it to be much easier. so i'm tied between the challenge and setting of it, either way both versions are fantastic! a great way to pass by time!"
2,"December 1, 2016"," Do you like the intricate strategy and complexity of 2048? Bad news, this game has none of that. You just randomly move the numbers and they randomly connect. Completely pointless."
3,"November 21, 2016"," Nekobukiya said to challenge yourself to beat higher than 2048 and that only one person has achieved 16384. Just because only one person achieved that doesn't mean it's hard, it only means no one else wanted to waste that much time in such an easy and mindless game."
2,"December 6, 2016",Too easy If you know how to add or even just match colors then you can master this game in about five seconds. No skill or strategy. Mildly entertaining at best.
5,"November 29, 2016","Amazing, runs smoothly, fun It's a great game,I just hate that it someone's gives you 4s,this has made me lose 90% of the time"
3,"December 29, 2016","If it never puts a 4 then it's perfect It has ads, there is no undo button and they put a stupid 4 instead of a 2 and screw you up"
2,"December 13, 2016","Too easy You don't even need to try, all you need to do is swipe downwards and you'll reach the goal in no time, way to make a nice complex puzzle game in to something so easy to beat a toddler could do it"
3,"November 20, 2016","Fun, but easy Really fun and a cool twist on the original game. That being said its insanely easy, I never once got to 2048 in the original game. In this version, I got it on my first try."
4,"December 2, 2016",Lol 16384 is what the devs said the highest achieved score worldwide was. I just got to 27388 after installing this yesterday.

I just got to 27388 after installing this yesterday. I mean this is a fun game and all but it ends way to quickly. Just like most of the square versions of 2048 allow you to change the grid size to higher than 4x4 this should also have an option to change the circle size so that the game lasts longer.
4,"April 26, 2017"," If you like 2048 AND Peggle or pachinko, this is your game!  I like the gyro option for letting the balls drop automatically.  Please put in option to adjust the rate of the balls dropping!!!"
5,"December 3, 2016","Enjoyed it for a while Really enjoyed it for a while there, but I've hit 61,240.. and after you get over 40k it takes way too long to beat your last scores"

I've not seen such clean and beautiful circular physics in a mobile game before (I'm doing a Master's Degree in physics this stuff genuinely interests me), the graphics plain and simple, very neat and pleasing to the eye. This isn't something with a lot of challenge though, I got above 2048 sat just swiping down while watching a YouTube video. However there is definitely some challenge in the gyro mode which I love and need to find some time to just sit and play see if I can actually beat it."
5,"March 11, 2017", I love it. The physics of the balls is so smooth. The only thing that I don't like is that it drains the battery fast
2,"July 23, 2017"," I was looking for a puzzle game but this is no puzzle game, just keep hitting the same direction. Might be good for entertaining little little kids if it made wacky sounds, but I couldn't hear any."
1,"November 16, 2016", Way to take a creative yet simple puzzle that tests in equal parts problem solving and skill and turn it into something that is built so steadfastly around random chance that it can barely be qualified as a game.
1,"November 18, 2016", There's literally no skill involved here. Just swipe left and right for a while and you'll get 2048. Useless game.
4,"January 14, 2017",Very easy Solved to 2048 and got bored on the first try.
5,"January 13, 2017",Great game. It's interest and different. I love it. Total boredom buster.
3,"November 30, 2016","Well ok I just swiped down, only ""down"" and I got 10000+...."
2,"March 5, 2017", The game is really unresponsive and the balls bounce around uneccessarily after you move them
4,"February 12, 2017", I like it but it makes me queasy LOL.  It gives me motion sickness...lol
5,"January 24, 2017"," This game is so awesome. The normal version is very nice, but this! It makes you addictet so you never want to stop playing. 5 stars for this great app."
4,"March 9, 2017"," Good game, good controls. Nice and fun to keep you occupied. I might go as far to say that the balls almost hypnotise you in a way, very relaxing."
2,"November 22, 2016",Can you call this a game? This requires about as much skill as rolling a ball downhill.
3,"September 5, 2016",Boring. No skill/thought required
5,"December 27, 2016",Awesome I reached 25560 points! I find this much easier than the first 2048 game. And it's so fun
1,"November 19, 2016",No point. You just swipe left and right until you get it. I'm not even sure it's possible to not win.
2,"August 16, 2017"," Good concept, way too easy. Was able to beat it first try and every time other."
5,"June 12, 2017", Scored 56734 in first days playing really fun. Love it. Good time consumer. My friend got 76k already
4,"December 1, 2016",Easy Its easy put gyro on and a bit moves now I got 16532 a high score nice game
2,"April 6, 2017", Great!  It would be better if there are sfx. Like 'marble rolling on wood' sound when it rolls
2,"May 13, 2017"," Nice idea, but... You can only swipe down and you win xdd Trust me"
5,"February 6, 2017"," 2048... finally after 10 times it took so long. Love the game, great timewaster"
5,"October 5, 2016",Haha I got the 16384 tile in a week!!!
5,"September 7, 2016",Love it Its very fun and addicting game and pls add more numbers that is higer than 2048
3,"January 16, 2017",No challenge here You can literally play these randomly
5,"February 28, 2018", Once you start you want to aim higher
5,"February 2, 2017"," Turns 2048 into a game of skill. The physics are fun, and the game runs smoothly."
3,"November 29, 2016",Can't get 2048 There isn't enough room
4,"June 3, 2017", Wish there was a Fibonacci× 360
4,"September 19, 2016",Good app but It is too easy. Got 2048 on the first try.
3,"January 15, 2017",Meh Gets old quick

5,"April 7, 2018", Great
1,"May 21, 2016", Easy
4,"December 1, 2016"," This game is a lot more complicated yet easier than regular 2048 if that makes any sense. Either way, loved the game, although I do prefer the original game more."
4,"November 24, 2016","Horrible game Simple design, dumb purpose, and very hard to lose. This game is literally so easy it is hard to lose"
4,"January 8, 2018"," Game is pretty good. Gyroscopic controls are fun but ineffective. Would consider this game to be the very definition of ""reinventing the wheel"""
3,"November 24, 2016","Nice idea but to little control This is a very nice variation on the 2048 game only it is lacking good control options, would be good to have besides the swipe also have a rotate option."
1,"May 11, 2017"," Too easy. I got to 2048 on my first shot, after about 10-15 minutes. Really boring and basically a easy version of the original"
1,"November 20, 2016",Impossable Its impossible. After 7 hours the highest I got was 512.  Just do this original cuz you can get 4096 in just 10-20 minutes
1,"December 7, 2016","Boring No point playing this, I got 12000 score from just swiping down"
1,"December 18, 2016",Horrible You only have to swipe in one direction to win. No challenge
1,"July 13, 2017","Hardware ""Your hardware does not support this application, sorry!"" BORING"
1,"December 9, 2016",This is just a meme. An unplayable meme. You have less control than ever.
1,"July 14, 2017"," I was WAY to easy. Plus, it is nothing like the original 2048. Its not even a challenge. So before you get it think is this something for me?"
2,"November 6, 2016",Ew Dis game sux 10/10 fight me irl
1,"November 5, 2016","Worst game Can't remove the game properly, not challenging  at all"
1,"November 20, 2016", Boring. Extremely easy.
1,"November 22, 2016",Battery Drain Eats so much battery
1,"December 27, 2016",Umm Didn't really like it the balls moved when I want touching them. Original is better
2,"December 10, 2016",Funish No skill needed but a great way to get younger folks into it
3,"November 22, 2016",Fun idea but... This game becomes boring quick.
2,"November 29, 2016","Nice Idea, but The game itself is determined on how the balls fall, and that is determined at random, so, not a puzzle game as 2048 is"
4,"May 21, 2017", It's okay though it needs a Android Wear Version.
5,"September 1, 2016", عالیه بازی خیلی خوبه
