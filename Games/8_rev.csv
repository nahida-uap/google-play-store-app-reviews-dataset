3,"July 2, 2018"," I paid for ad free. There are still little ads at bottom of screen. Also 
the 5 move rewind button doesn't appear."
2,"April 13, 2018", The ads are horrendous. Constant multiple ads after each button push. Choose an dad and another opens.
1,"April 13, 2018", I hated the ads every time you ended a game. Make an ads free version.
1,"April 10, 2018"," Ads ads ads ads and more ads. They disable and close other media, radio, mp3 etc. Swiping is not accurate avoid!"
1,"May 9, 2018"," Downloads ads to your phone, only music in my library is their ad noises, 
don't download!"
1,"May 20, 2018"," Could be good however the constant bombardment of ads is just to much 
ruined the game. Uninstalled after less then 2 hours"
3,"April 12, 2018", I personally don't like it because it has way to many adds
5,"May 27, 2018", It's an educational game that increases your sense of thinking/calculation
1,"May 13, 2018"," very bad , to much reklama"
3,"June 7, 2018", I pay for ad free but ads keep coming back.
1,"April 19, 2018", Ads... Before I can even play... Deleted

1,"March 24, 2018"," Before I could even start my first game the ads started. Once the ad completed, I enjoyed uninstalling this game."
3,"March 26, 2018", There are way to many ads and that's why I give it a 3
1,"March 22, 2018", It is the worst game even though i haven't played it yet

5,"March 22, 2018", This game get your brain workingü§ë
1,"March 24, 2018", ad after installing and starting first game...uninstalled without a second thought! LOL
1,"March 30, 2018", 12 ads just to start the app. Not worth it
1,"April 3, 2018", This is obviously not the original. The game is fine but I don't like companies to lie.
5,"March 22, 2018", I   think that this is a good game b becauses it shows how to add
1,"March 22, 2018", To many  ads
5,"March 18, 2018", It is an intense stragety game
1,"March 12, 2018", Ugh!  2048 ads. Too much.  Especially when they play sound.  Uninstalled before I finished 1st game.
4,"March 16, 2018", I paid the .99 for no ads and it is still showing ads before loading the game. I'm not a happy camper.
5,"May 16, 2018", It's fun but you should make even bigger platforms than 8√ó8
5,"March 10, 2018", Utterly addictive!
2,"April 4, 2018", Too many adds... even after paying
1,"March 9, 2018", So many ads.
1,"March 5, 2018"," Look... I love this game. I played it when it first came out, it's simple and additive. But you can't play in peace anymore. It's all add. I don't mind a few but there were so many!!! And it was difficult to click out of them. It's disappointing. I used to love this app."
5,"March 3, 2018"," This game is epic especially t he gameplay and it really helps you head think on good strategies so you could train on this and then use that strategy to win a real life game  Clever I must say  Sincerely, Dahia garcia"
5,"March 9, 2018"," I love when the game developers listen!! , this game was spoilt by ads but I'm happy to report its now perfectly playable!  Yes ads are still in this game but with some clever moving around they don't interfere at all.  Thanks guys/girls for your update, this one now has my seal of approval :D"
5,"February 26, 2018", Its awesome if you just want a brain teeser

Every time I use task manager it reloads automatically. Suspect spying on me. No reason for a game to run when I am not using it... Especially when the disclaimer says it needs full network access and to have my location... Uninstalled.... In reply to developer response, I understand network access for ads, I do not understand why it needs to know where I am, and I do not understand why the program stays loaded when I close all programs with the task manager and it stays resident. I do not want a game to stay resident when I am not playing it and the only reason it would need to do so is to track my movements for  ads. I do not want that or will allow that."
5,"February 8, 2018", A very nice game.But there should also be a fullscreen option.
5,"February 13, 2018"," Still the same 2048 but with more choices of play boards (3x3 , 5x5 etc..)"
5,"February 12, 2018", Very exciting game! Improving math skills at the same time.
2,"February 7, 2018", It keeps starting my game that I've been playing for a while all over again. And I keep losing my high score.
5,"February 9, 2018"," Very nice game, addictive, nice design..."
5,"February 9, 2018", This is the best one of 2048 game

3,"October 26, 2017"," Too many ads, you cant even skip them, you need to sit through s minute long ad after each loss"
1,"November 3, 2017", Game itself was fine apart from an advert appearing every time I breathed out!
1,"January 28, 2018", Too many ads.
1,"November 15, 2017"," Paid to remove ads, and there are still ads!"
1,"November 15, 2017", This game is trash
1,"December 1, 2017", Stupid amount of ads
1,"December 1, 2017", Too many ads.

5,"December 30, 2017", It is awesome
2,"October 5, 2017"," Fed up with all of the ads. And every time I tried to restart a new game, it played an ad and then took me back to the game I had just lost. So then I had to press restart new game again and watch another ad. Sometimes this would happen 3 or 4 times in a row."
3,"September 29, 2017"," I was just hot and now im really cold, so my socks are sweaty and making my feet even colder :("
1,"September 26, 2017", Push notifications to try to get you to play more = instant uninstall.
2,"September 30, 2017", Ads are too invasive. Uninstalled.

5,"October 7, 2017", AMAZING
3,"October 4, 2017", Fine
1,"September 9, 2017", Just full of ads. Don't even bother
1,"September 12, 2017", I don't need a game to notify me that it's there... I know it's there and will play it when I feel like it.
1,"September 10, 2017", My top score was deleted together with my working game....
5,"September 13, 2017", No lags and bugs so far. Well done.
3,"September 3, 2017", The amount of adds is annoying. You get one after another. Other than that it's a pretty good game.
5,"September 9, 2017", I never realized just how much I would be addicted to this game! Love how I can play it without a data connection too!
2,"September 3, 2017", Too many ads and requested to make phone calls and use location services. Why?
1,"September 6, 2017", Erm why do you need to make phone calls and use gps.
5,"September 5, 2017", Great to pass the time
2,"August 22, 2017", Layout is HORRIBLE.  Game has a button that allows you to imeditaltely advance to 256 after watching a short video.  Only problem is the button is ALWAYS active so you can be working towards 4096 when suddenly your presented with an ad and sent back to 256.  Simply Stupid decision.
1,"August 25, 2017"," Lost ALL of my progress with update, and now my high score shows as 0... Super pissed! I was well over 100,000 points and growing.... Now I'm back to 0...."
1,"August 30, 2017", Waaaaaaaaaaay too many ads. They pop up every few seconds.
1,"August 22, 2017", Terrible adds before game even starts.
1,"August 27, 2017", So many ads.
2,"August 1, 2017", My game was deleted before I could finish and I have proof because I took screenshots. I AM NOT HAPPY!!!
5,"August 1, 2017", It is the best to stimulat the mind.
5,"July 30, 2017"," Great app, devs listen to us which is fantastic. Thanks for being so prompt :)"
1,"September 15, 2017", All these goddam ads. So fired.
1,"July 15, 2017", Poorly designed for my phone
2,"July 15, 2017", It was a great app until you added ads after every freaking move
4,"July 13, 2017", The game works.  No reason to nag me if I do not play all the time. Annoying and worthy to be removed
5,"July 13, 2017"," It's a great game I love it soooo much,although it gets pretty tough"
5,"August 2, 2017", Very nice game! New features are very good. For example undo function is not exist many 2048 games which is so important for me.  So this game is my favorite puzzle game.
1,"July 7, 2017"," Okay, so there is an add bar on it, that rest right over the replay, home, etc. Buttons. Its really fing angering üòí hope you get it fixed, but for now, uninstalling."
1,"July 13, 2017", The game ends for no reason and ad appears
3,"June 28, 2017", the advertisements made my game super duper lag
3,"June 11, 2017"," This is a really addicting game, the only problem is, it doesn't save, I was in the middle of a game, where I had over 500,000 points, I had to take a break, and when I went back to it later, the board cleared without saving my score"
5,"June 12, 2017", It is knowledge game
5,"June 16, 2017", It is a mind game....
1,"June 11, 2017", Not the original

5,"June 2, 2017", Excellent puzzle game!
5,"June 4, 2017", Brainee
5,"May 23, 2017", Very nice update
5,"May 20, 2017", I loved :)
1,"March 18, 2018", I never review apps. This simple diversion of a game is ruined with constant ads and no way to restart a game without at least three videos. Absolutely a joke. Made even worse with ads free versions available elsewhere.
2,"August 13, 2017"," Consent to collect browsing data? Seriously? From a numbers game. Also the constant bombardment of full screen/minimum watch time ads is a bit much- albeit tolerable.

From a numbers game. Also the constant bombardment of full screen/minimum watch time ads is a bit much- albeit tolerable. But the request to collect device and browsing data? Wow. Immediate uninstall. (no I dont care that it gives the option to opt out, it shouldn't be going down that road to begin with)"
1,"October 22, 2017", The ads are an outrage. I've never been bothered by ads before to the point that I would uninstall the app and write a bad review. But here we are.
1,"December 10, 2017"," Adds are loud even when phone settings have volume to 0. Controls are not robust, had to undo frequently because wrong direction was captured"
5,"July 20, 2017", features neverseen before: 5undo and replaying with high number tiles. These made me addicted to it ;)
1,"August 10, 2017"," My game was deleted when I accidentally touched the advance button. Highly upset when I had been playing for weeks and my score was over 500,000. This was not the first time. Just deleted it so I would not have to dress over this again."
1,"August 20, 2017", The gameplay is nice but the ads are incredibly invasive. The entire experience is constructed to make you buy the full game.
1,"April 1, 2018", The worst game I have ever seen in my life
1,"September 3, 2017", Was a great game until it asked for access to my phone calls and wouldnt let me play
3,"June 13, 2017", The game is ok but it can get boring over all it is a good game
3,"September 5, 2017"," Too many adds, doesn't save your progress. I've has to restart multiple times without needing to."
1,"December 2, 2017", Ads are Insane and are way to many in number
1,"March 18, 2018", This game is good but there r to many adds it says do you want to watch a video to get a reward I press no but it still shows a video I hate this gammeüòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüôçüôçüôçüôçüôçüôçüôç
1,"March 27, 2018", Would of been a good game if it didn't constantly reset when getting a decent score
1,"September 30, 2017", The amount of ads you have to watch is unreal. Get a grip. Do not install
5,"June 9, 2017", It's a horror story
5,"April 8, 2018", Just off ur wifi if too mny ads brah
