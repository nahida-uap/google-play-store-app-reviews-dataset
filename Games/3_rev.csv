two things that are alike with using like or as"
1,"February 16, 2018", Seems it doesn't keep a running save of your game or at least you can lose your progress for no apparent reason. Can be particularly frustrating when you're on a 100k score streak.
4,"August 7, 2017", It's a fun game which anyone can play. I play this everytime I am bored but i still love it. If there were any challenges or some sort of mini  games in the game which involve 2048 tiles would be the best thing.  Love it otherwise
3,"November 27, 2017"," It's a very exciting game  But it's extremely frustrating when you inadvertently touch the screen it moves and messes up your game play. There is no ""take back"" ability to remedy this."
4,"July 3, 2017"," A good time waster, but nothing else. Very challenging and brain taxing when trying to complete, but not a good math tool for anyone who passed 2nd grade multiplication."
2,"June 16, 2018"," Animations make progress much too slow and feel buggy. No need for a little 
shimmer at the point at which the numbers merge. Takes twice as long to 
play as a normal game"
5,"October 31, 2017", Sometimes the board fills up and I don't get 2048... Great game anyway!
4,"March 3, 2018", Overall an awesome game. The only thing I would do is the possibility to undo more than 1 step but that would decrease the difficulty of the game though.
5,"September 9, 2017"," Loved it! This is so addicting! If you haven't downloaded it already do it now! Plus I'm 13 years old so don't think it's for ""old"" people lmao."
5,"August 9, 2017", I love it. It teaches me to think outside the box and add up high numbers. I thank this game forgiving me something really easy but really educational to learn from.
4,"September 13, 2017", I really like the game and it is a really good time waster but there is one problem. Whenever I get close to losing but I can see a direct path to match a lot of tiles it just says that I lost.  Fix and I rate 5
1,"March 12, 2018", You don't get to see the field after you 'lost'. The app itself is very resource hungry and drains your battery faster than an electric chair.
3,"August 6, 2017", I always end up at 666 for some reason must be a bit faulty. Since installing this game I had multiple paranormal activities going on in my house and for some reason at 3 am I keep seeing a deformed chubaca chanting at my window. Don't install this game my warning.
5,"October 26, 2017", I think it's a wonderful game cause I'm a math geek kinda but I don't think of it as math it is just a fun learning game that keeps you oqhupied  so you should download it but if you don't like it that it might not be your tipe of game.          THANK YOU
3,"January 27, 2018", It makes me loose even if i still can play. It gets very annoying
1,"October 25, 2017", Did it on first go. Ok just swiped up down and left .. never right and aim to make biggest numbers in bottom right corner. Done!
3,"December 1, 2017", You guys do know that there are test ads appearing right? Wish the 2048 games didn't  all look identical.
5,"April 11, 2018", Easy and relaxing to play but hard to master. Making new numbers is oddly ssatisfying. Good job guys
3,"September 9, 2017", Keeps saying game over when I moves remaining.
4,"October 5, 2017"," A very fun game,helps to improve brain power,challenging,but not too challenging,just how I like it to be,however the ads inbetween the gameplay is annoying,I hope that you will fix that with the next update,then I will rate 5 stars."
5,"May 26, 2018"," It is addictive and fun if you know the mechanics of the game. I would 
recommend this game for anyone who has patience.:)"
3,"June 23, 2017", It's ok. Sometimes it adds a number set you didn't want to.  Like 2 2 2 2 will end up 2 4 2.
1,"August 8, 2017", When I opened the app the game wouldn't give me any tiles to start the game with
2,"June 26, 2017", Game randomly ends when there are still moves to be made. I dislike the game ending randomly.
5,"March 28, 2018", Boring at first but then you cannot stop playing this game
1,"December 24, 2017", Not the best way to spend your time. 🤗
2,"March 24, 2018", It will not run unless it is in offline mode. Poor product quality.
2,"October 7, 2017", It lags a lot and ends when I can still make moves
5,"March 3, 2018", Really fun app although very boring since i found it easy to get to 2040
4,"May 27, 2018"," When it's game over, it could have your score in the middle of the screen 
so you can notice it better. Other than that it's amazing!☺"
1,"February 22, 2018", So bad wish i had never instaled
5,"July 2, 2017", I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS Game I had it on my tablet it is awesome and very addictive my dad got me addicted to it and I still have it on my tablet  phone and iPad mini
1,"July 5, 2018"," If i close the app even if i hadn't lost it starts over and thats not fair 
i was almost to 8192 and something came up not cool please fix"
3,"June 23, 2017", It's a really good game but it shouldnt show us what to do it should tell us and if we have trouble it asks us if we need help.
2,"September 27, 2017", The framerate makes it unbearable to play
4,"July 18, 2017"," I like how we can learn math in this game, too."
5,"November 29, 2017", I love this game it's so addictive and I love playing it
2,"September 9, 2017"," Sluggish response times, and this is on a Galaxy S8"
5,"July 21, 2017", So much fun  and super easy!😁
5,"July 11, 2017", Finaly the ketchapp 2048 is available on android. Had been waiting for thIs since I moved from ios to android. Thanks Ketchapp
5,"July 9, 2017"," Finally, a good 2048. Sometimes I just wish people could develop good games that are meaningful and don't cost anything."
1,"November 26, 2017", WORST GAME EVER IN THE F#####G WORLD
1,"October 2, 2017", Ads popped up and restarted it.
5,"July 5, 2018", Cool game you are imaginative bro nice game love you all gays

5,"August 7, 2017", I want autosave the game. exiting must autosave.
1,"January 8, 2018", Doesn't fit screen. Squares are outside border
5,"June 12, 2018"," This game was awesome when I was traviling. This game never glitched when i 
played it. This game never got me bored. I think they should make a game 
4554. Exellent game"

5,"July 4, 2018"," I got 5,000 first try. Good for the brain!"
3,"October 21, 2017", It's a little boring.
4,"December 26, 2017"," I like the simplicity of the game, but I don't like the changes that have been made to 'improve' the gameplay"
4,"October 2, 2017"," It is fun, anyone can play it. I always end up with 666 for someone's reason."
1,"February 13, 2018", ITS HORABLE PLEASE DONT PLAY SO BORINGGGGGGG
4,"August 8, 2017"," This is the real / original 2048, So this is the one that you should get.   P.S. it's the best one."
5,"September 9, 2017", A good game for the mind but it is hard to mve with
5,"July 15, 2017"," 28.40 Mb app size, I see what you did there lol"
5,"June 16, 2017"," It's awesome! Everyone should play it. It's good for your math skills,it's fun and pretty addicting."
4,"February 22, 2018"," Fun at first, kind of then gets boring"
5,"October 9, 2017", Really fun but not epic
5,"June 27, 2018"," i got 200.000 points and a block of 16.000 in my first game. i am the 
WorldRecord in this game."
5,"July 19, 2017", you have to switch from 2 to 4.  150 the most of their is a wall and you.
5,"January 15, 2018", I love this game it's so fun to play and sometimes low key triggers me when I die

3,"December 4, 2017"," The app itself is great, but there are far to many ads that pop up right as I'm swiping, and they take me to the Play store. I recommend this game only if you play on airplane mode."
4,"June 27, 2017", It is very addicting and hard and frustrating.  It's a great game and it's for all ages
2,"August 18, 2017", Opened the app and accidentally clicked on 2 ads before the actual game even started.   It does not work well with the S8 fullscreen feature.   Also it's a shameless rip-off of an original game.
1,"March 21, 2018", All I wanted to do is listen to my music on sound cloud and then this game keeps turning it off and puts on stupid ads
1,"January 2, 2018", I have enough storage but it doesnt want to download and when it finally downloaded it was slow and boring in conclusion this game sucks booty
5,"June 23, 2017", The game was so addicting and I could not stop playing
