I'm still playing on that same round,  and my current biggest number is 16348. It's really easy to figure out without instructions, but it makes you think."

Still, like I said, great game to burn a bit of time. And the new undo update is perfect!"

People will regularly comment on the where they are in the game when they see us playing."
3,"December 11, 2015",RAM eater It's a great game and playing on a 6x6 board is Zen-like but for such a simple game it eats battery like no other. I just about can't play unless I'm either plugged in or I accept my phone's premature death.
3,"August 30, 2016",Too easy It's fun but there is no challenge. I'm watching TV playing this without really trying and I got whatever 2048 times 16 is. I thought it was a fluke but I'm playing again and it is too easy. Not challenging enough. Embarrassed that I posted my results on Facebook. A baby could do this

It's also harder because the tiles are more spread out, and there's more opportunity for them to build up into a massive staircase shape.

3,"January 18, 2017", I downloaded a few days ago and still playing my first game. There is no end and it's not challenging at all. I prefer the original 2048.  I do hate how slow the tiles move. I feel like I'm playing in slow motion and falling asleep while doing it.
5,"October 21, 2016","Great stress-reliever Whenever I have a tough situation going on, I automatically go to this. It helps me think subconsciously about a problem and I am then quickly able to find a solution. Thanks so much for making this app! Would love a response."

2,"June 30, 2016",Okay It takes up very little space but the only catch is that its never-ending. I've been playing for a good week and my score is 709528. So it's not challenging at all.
3,"May 9, 2016","Addictive, but... ...surprisingly easy! Compared to the original game it's ridiculous - on my first ever game playing this I ended up with 131072...as well as a couple of 2048s, 4096s and 8192s on the same board. Ridiculously addictive but no challenge!"
5,"December 5, 2016",Dont Panic Update of this swapped the app icon between 2048 and 2048+  Thought I had lost my million tile. Still there though...phew. Great time passing app that needs a bit of tactics.
4,"December 16, 2015",Awesome!! But.. Its was really an awesome game untull I realised that I just have to swipe up-right-down-left over and over a 1000 times to reach the 4096th tile. Try making it a bit difficult.
2,"January 26, 2016",Misses key part of game Although the large grid is fun. The new tiles continue to be small numbers. This means unless you like 4 month games you will find this glacially slow compared to original 2048.
4,"October 5, 2016","Good for distraction The big board is far to easy but it is stupidly addictive. I got to 77k before I got bored of trying to lose. However, I have started the 4x4 board and it's much more challenging and enjoyable"
3,"May 9, 2016"," I used to just play 2084 and found that challenging and decided to challenge myself some more. This however is not the answer. After playing off and on for a few days now, I already at a unbelievable high score. Great time to kill time but honestly it's not worth it."
5,"November 12, 2016","Just reach my 2 million tiles. I think I waste too much time on these endless additive game, just reach my 2 million tiles, time to stop.  What is the point to confirm a backup!"
5,"November 7, 2016","I didn't think it'd be this good! It's simple, challenging but easy all in one. It has multiple themes to choose from to make your game experience more personalized and fun!"
4,"January 28, 2017"," Most of the time it is too easy but once you stack up enough of the yellow and lilac pieces it has some challenge. I would wish for a scoreboard, played the game once and stopped at some 6 point something millions, it would be nice to know how that compares to the rest of the players."
5,"August 30, 2016", Awesome way to kill some time. I always leave it and continue the same game next time I'm a bit bored. My biggest tile is now 65 536. Wanna see the colour of the next one up... (update: it was blue)
3,"March 21, 2016","Fun to change game size but... A larger board just makes the game easier. The most challenging is 3x3, but it's nearly impossible because it clogs so fast. The best balance between possible and difficult is 4x4, but that's the original game. 3 stars for trying something new, but the new features don't do much for the game."
5,"March 25, 2017", How did it restart by mistake and I can't hit undo to get back to my previous game? I lost weeks worth of work twice recently.

My only suggestion is to make the undo option have the ability to go back more than one swipe.  The board is so large that it requires rapid swipes.

1,"December 15, 2014","Too easy They claim it is more challenging, but this version is wayyy easier. Solved it first try, and I even messed up pretty bad a couple of times. Stick to the first one"
1,"December 20, 2014","Bad Update The update on 18.12.2014 is very upseting and annoying. Pushes a lot of Ad's. And when I tried to use Cristmaas Skin, the game is not at all starting, so much so that I m removing it from my cell. Can I get the earlier version?"
1,"December 21, 2014",Ok but ... Ads cover a third of the bottom line - VERY frustrating. Have uninstalled
1,"December 20, 2014",Won't open! Every time I try to play it won't open. Why download if u can't play!??

3,"December 9, 2014","So so I like this app, however: after 385k points i had to reset  my game because it made movements  that I did not made. If the undo was not limited  to 1 move, I'd  give it a 5 star."

I'm always thinking of pressing restart but then I'm like no. Its just addictive I guess and it gets annoying how I can't die but I never delete it or start over. Its just an annoyingly-addictive game.
4,"June 8, 2014","Great app, but don't like the new update Awesome game to play, but the new update made the boards bigger, and the ads block the bottom and it's hard to maneuver.

1,"October 21, 2014","Keeps wigging out When I swipe left it goes down or up or something other than left fairly frequently. The Chem skin is cool, but I don't want to play a game that doesn't allow me to move properly"
5,"November 3, 2014","1 million and done! My personal goal was to reach 1 million. Not points, but a million+ point tile on the 6x6 grid. Got it with 25 million+ points. Got the screen cap to prove it! Took me a good month playing for 10-15 minutes at a time, 2-3 times a day. Now I can delete it and move on to other things..."

I've been at my first round for approximately three weeks now, opening the game from time to time whenever I'm bored or feel like I need to relax. I just recently beat my first million points and to know that there is more to come just makes me very happy. No problems or bugs whatsoever."

This was I'm sure eliminated by the REAL 2048 creator before even making it because the math proved how it would be infinitely easier and a waste of fingers. Had to quit or blisters would ensue.
4,"October 30, 2014","Automove As a being that follows the laws of gravity, I prefer having the higher values at the bot while 2s & 4s go top. Automove does the opposite, leaving me with a sandwich of even numbers."
5,"September 13, 2014",Finally hit 2 million tile For the people saying it is to easy change the board size. For the people crying about the ad. At the bottom if your board is filling up and the ad is in the way your doing something wrong....
4,"July 12, 2014"," Loved this app until now - all of a sudden there are adds coming up at the bottom that cover the bottom of the board making it very hard to play. Don't know why it's all of a sudden, I've had the app for a week or two."
4,"June 30, 2014",Great time waster! Great way to keep on playing the same game on. However there is a problem - control is so sensetive that having a finger too close to the screen when thinking causes a move. It's not fun when this happens and you have 32k blocks on there board.
2,"September 13, 2014",I like the game not the app I think the tiles are too small. I sipped the auto button on accident and it was like watching someone else play. This game is easier than the other 2048 game I played but it is also challenging to me. I won the first time and it was so easy and boring.
1,"July 23, 2014",Waste of time Just go around in circles and you keep winning.. no thought process needed.. Nothing.. Just a plain stupid game. Original 2048 version was good..
4,"June 9, 2014","Too easy If you're looking for an actual challenge don't get this knockoff, the board being too big made it possible for me to complete the game the 1st time I played it."
4,"August 10, 2014","Pretty fun waste of time I love the game, but now that I passed a score of 10,000,000 in 8x8, the + next to the 2048 dropped down and made my playing field move down.

5,"June 25, 2014",Better than original Ignore all the idiots saying that the board is too big. They just dont understand how settings work
3,"October 19, 2014",It will ruin your life. I'm playing this for like 2 hours a day and i just can't stop. It's ridiculous. Deleting it now because i want my life back. But it has been great.
4,"September 26, 2014",Good but too addictive Only played this game once. Played for an hour or two roughly a day for a couple of weeks. Highly addictive though...my boyfriend started to confiscate my phone so I wouldn't play. Deleting it now!
3,"August 8, 2014","Long, but not challenging I achieved the 2048 square on my first try, but it took a while. The large space takes the challenge away. Kinda boring, not my cup of tea."
3,"August 28, 2014",Decent game I downloaded and played this once and on my very first try it took me 15 maybe 20 minutes to get 2048. Little to easy for me. Could be because I played the game THREES.
5,"July 26, 2014","Best 2048 game out there!! I like the idea of auto move,also how hard i try to lose the game I can't so I should call this game as the “never ending 2048”."
5,"September 25, 2014",I love its awesome :-) Its awesome its like the best game I have played ever and/PS im 8 and have bin playing this game or installed it Sept 25 2014 And it keep it up its so awesome and ya sorry about the other people that aren't being nice about the comments so ya love it plz make more like it and ya bye :-)
5,"June 4, 2014","Previously stuck on 8 miljon piece! 33554432 in one piece now, thanks for fixing that bug!"
4,"June 12, 2014","Fun, but... I've found that the game can be jumpy and ""double move"" causing frustration. But for the most part, a fun game."
1,"June 6, 2014",Addictive I installed this after I got addicted to the first one. The problem is google has an ad directly at the bottom of my screen completely blocking my view of the last row. I've tried everything and it's still there! That means I CAN'T PLAY IT!  Either tell me what to do or I'm uninstalling
4,"July 8, 2014", Only one undo allowed? That's awfully unforgiving. Fun though.
3,"July 24, 2014","I Love the game, but.... I've been playing the same board for over a month. But as my score gets larger, my board gets smaller. I can only see 5 1/2 of the 8 lines. PLEASE FIX!!"
5,"October 3, 2014",Great But i have a problem on android 4.2.2 two days ago it stopped working i tried reinstalling it but it didn't help. What is the problem?
4,"September 16, 2014","Chemistry! :D Chemical elements? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY FREE TIME (since I don't have money)! Only problem is, the animation is too slow; I swipe faster than it can handle and it gets confused."
5,"August 29, 2014","Good Game Add an option to reset custom skin. Anyway the longer one plays, the more boring it gets"
5,"July 20, 2014", I play this game from last month and still going until now. I have found 2097152 tile. Addictive and I don't know how to stop.
4,"September 6, 2014", It'd be 5 stars if it didn't adjust after I hit 100 thousand points and cause the ads to block my view of the whole bottom row. It's nice to be able to see all of the numbers you have. Doesn't seem to matter which board either..
5,"June 4, 2014",Amazing This game has no faults and you can undo a move if it is accidently moved the wrong way.  I would definately reccommend it.
1,"July 12, 2014"," When I tried to download it, when it said 75% it stopped downloading. Is it my phone or the app?"
1,"July 9, 2014",Don't waste your time Downloaded app first move I went counter clockwise and no matter what the tiles looked like I continued going counter clockwise and after 20 minutes had a 4096 tile over 50 thousand points. .....could have gone on forever probably. ....waste of time........deleted
5,"September 1, 2014",Great app Awsome really addictive. I like the second chance and the new update. And there are different grid sizes which the original 2048 did.  I would recommend it to anyone:-)
2,"October 22, 2014",Too much of a knock-off Creator didn't work out the math quite right. The 8x8 board is WAY too easy once you figure out what the pattern should look like.
4,"September 5, 2014","Addicting To a developed brain could play this game could go forever, it has a satisfactory scoreboard method and a unique type of goal. You can continue to play the same game for days without having to deal with any obstacles commonly found in the original 2048 game."
5,"June 17, 2014","I just can't get enough! Wow, what a surprise this one was! I thought I'd get bored after an hr or so but after winning the game a couple of wks ago I am still playing every day! I have some insane amount of points, too.;)"
4,"October 4, 2014",Its good Its the only game that keeps my boredom away
1,"July 10, 2014","Crap with adware Sorry dude, don't besmirch my 2048 with crap advertisements."
1,"August 1, 2014",Hi I would have given it one more star but sometimes i keep playing it and get bored so you have to keep it more interesting so that the person can keep playing it and luv it:-! But good
5,"September 10, 2014","I actually lost. I did it. It took forever but I did it. When I look in the comment section, I see nothing but untapped potential. If I can do it so can you."
4,"October 5, 2014", Very addictive It  does stop I had to make myself find out if it ends n it does but it would b hours before or days before u get yo he over very very addictive
4,"June 18, 2014",Fun But way too easy. Still on first go after weeks....
2,"July 7, 2014",Good idea! I really like the idea but the gameplay doesn't feel as smooth as the original 2048. I will rate 5 stars if it get fix
5,"September 27, 2014","Awesome.. I reached a score of 9 million in 5x5 game.. In 2 weeks And game is still on, and would love to see if someone on earth has been doing such high scores .."
1,"July 12, 2014",So stupid Wanna win draw a square over and over the game will play itself for you and you will win.
2,"June 12, 2014",New update Just did the new update and now the adds cover my bottom line ... fix it and I will rate better
5,"September 11, 2014","Great game I have only played 1 game and I'm at 500,000+ and counting. Anyway love it, because it's like normal 2048, but with more stuff."
5,"August 19, 2014",My favorite First I hate this game after I loved it this is not at all boring

1,"August 8, 2014","Cant be downloaded. -.-"" It doesnt install. I hate it."
4,"September 2, 2014","Good game Really like the fact that it's not just 2048, it has more different sizes of the board you play on"

5,"July 19, 2014",must try 
5,"May 7, 2014",My life is over. This is an excellent app but it's taken over my life. I have become so obsessed with beating my boyfriend I'm losing sleep over this.
4,"May 18, 2014","Amazing I love this app, but a leader board where everyone could see the best scores would be awesome. This is such a time killer! I'm obsessed"
1,"May 13, 2014","Crap. No landscape orientation support so you have to play sideways.  AI feature is neat, but the AI is so awful it can't even solve to 1024."
5,"May 10, 2014",Amazing Both in game and theory. This app teaches us how to think outside of the box in a fun and creative way. This is one addicting game I will not be giving up on or deleting anytime soon!
5,"May 31, 2014","Wow I've been trying to lose this game for a month but its impossible,  I applaud the game for that. Never in my have have I not been able to purposely lose a game before"
2,"May 26, 2014",Bug I have been playing this game for 2 days. I made a tile of 16384 and was working on making another 16384 to join them.  But out of no where 65536 pops up. Surely a bug somewhere.
5,"May 12, 2014","Very good app Once, while undoing, the game glitched and filled the grid, otherwise it is fantastic. Alternate skins and grid sizes are great"
5,"May 8, 2014",It's took over my life I've spent hours but my finger's still swapping. Please let the game over! Please....
3,"May 12, 2014","Good. However, it is missing some features. Please add unlimited undos and a dark theme! Also, could the auto move be a bit smarter? Will give five stars when these features are added."
5,"May 30, 2014",Love this game This is one of my fav versions of this game. I can play it for hours. Very very addictive.
4,"May 9, 2014","32768 with 500k points Current record, but I don't know if it's The best I can do, because the game isn't over yet."

5,"May 20, 2014", It's a fun game. I love all of the different settings. Changing the skins is my favorite :)
5,"May 14, 2014"," Game continues even after the goal, 2048, had been reached"
5,"May 9, 2014",Nope Record 65536 with 1 Million+ points
5,"May 23, 2014",Best ever I think this game is better than don't step on the white tiles

I just can't put it down. It took me all night to drink one beer because I couldn't stop playing long enough to take another swig. It's ruined my sex life because I'm more interested in playing this than shagging. Only 4 stars because the undo button only undoes one move! Otherwise it would be 5 stars.
5,"May 1, 2014",Flexible for long lifetime You can keep trying new things in this one so the game is a lot of fun and won't get boring Also I was wondering if someone could explain the differences between the auto move modes (swing etc) and the sliding modes (continuous etc)
5,"May 4, 2014","Runs great and an addictive game! Runs surprisingly well for such a big board and all the extra stuff, also allot of fun!"
3,"May 4, 2014",Why so easy Is this game supposed to be really easy? Am I missing a specific goal in what makes it challenging?
1,"May 6, 2014",Banner ads in the way Can't play the game because the ads cover the bottom row.  Worthless
5,"May 4, 2014",Pootispencer Im bob copy and paste him so he can take over
5,"May 1, 2014", I love it but the ads are blocking the bottom tiles. I cannot see that part tho.
1,"May 1, 2014", Can only swipe down and left. Very glitchy
5,"April 29, 2014",So additive! The best and challenging by far.  Awesome!
4,"April 29, 2014",Great additions Well designed. 4-star because of one undo only.
5,"May 1, 2014",Ads at bottom of screen Ads at bottom of screen so you can not see the bottom of the screen as you not see the game proper
5,"April 30, 2014",Great Super fun and a great time passer must get

5,"May 4, 2014",Wicked Addictive and super number fun!
5,"May 2, 2014", very good
5,"April 23, 2014","Save functionality Users should be allowed to play multiple games, save old game and start other game type. I want to try your new grid 3x3 but dont want to lose the big game im playing on 8x8 mode."
5,"April 24, 2014",Marvelous Conserved 2048's addictiveness but easier to play.
3,"April 22, 2014","To big The game is to easy, the hart is to lost"
5,"April 23, 2014",Love it Love the regular updates. Also like the different sizes.

And I thought that that was the biggest grid, so I decided to stay committed to it. So a total of about 8-10 hours of game play later, such such tedious gameplay.... and finally the moment I had been waiting for for so long, matching the two 32.7k tiles to get the 65k tile.. and they just disappeared. I had messed up a few times so I ended up having 3 separate 32k tiles. I had a score of about 1.2 million and pretty much gave up."
3,"April 20, 2014",Auto run improvement Let us make our own patterns to be repeated on auto run then I will rate 5 stars
1,"April 21, 2014",Too booring You loose your time
5,"April 20, 2014","I can only get to 8! Jk, great game"
4,"April 18, 2014",Love it Easy but still fun. :)
5,"April 18, 2014",Awesome! Very addictive 
2,"April 17, 2014"," It was very difficult to swipe the squares in all of the modes. Advertisements blocked nearly half of my screen so I could not see what I was doing. It would be nice, I think, to have a proper menu. If you fixed this I would give a higher rating."
2,"April 13, 2014", I got the game updated and then lost my game I've been working on for 5 or so days... SO MAD!!!!
1,"April 14, 2014",After update terrible The update doesn't let you use all the autorun features and it makes u chose a board size. I hate this
1,"April 15, 2014",Geeez Difference from original....this has bigger place to move and works slower than original and has annoying ad down at screen all the time.so...useless tbh.
1,"April 16, 2014",Sucks It wont even let me download the app and i have full bars and more than enough memory
1,"April 14, 2014","Lost game!! The weekend update lost me a massive score and I was at tile 65,536!! Not impressed at all."
2,"April 14, 2014",Some upgrades are not While I have lost several games in progress but with the save option I could save the partial game. Further this was the only version with the corner autoplay. Want it back
4,"April 16, 2014",Sensitive Good game but the swiping is very sensitive. If I barely touch the screen it will swipe when I don't want it to.
5,"April 16, 2014","Excellent, but... Great porting. I can only play the 6x6 version tho..."
5,"April 13, 2014",Not laggy now! The java version works great! But will you put the 8x8 board again?
5,"April 16, 2014", This will bring up apocalegeddon day
1,"April 13, 2014"," Hating the new update. The game was more enjoyable before it. Wiped my highscore of 600, 000+"
5,"April 12, 2014", Doesn't work with update
4,"April 9, 2014","Update Problems For those of you that are having problems with the update, uninstall the game and reinstall it. After I tried that my game started working :)"
3,"April 17, 2014","Doesn't work A whiteish screen comes up when I open it, Good idea though."
3,"April 8, 2014","Won't start After the update, whenever I open the app up, not a single block will spawn for me to move around. I try swiping but still, nothing. :/"
1,"April 8, 2014", Got to play the game once and now it doesn't work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but it still does not work
1,"April 8, 2014",Bad update Program no longer works since update
1,"April 9, 2014", Dont work
4,"April 6, 2014","Nice but It's gonna be very difficult to beat the game, say if you swipe every one second, it'll will take you around 30 years non stop to get to that 2 billion tiles... Sure you can use the automatic (cheat) moves reducing the time by maybe 10... That upscale of the '2048 game' is unbeatable! Fun though"
1,"April 6, 2014"," Even with the save and load if I don't come back and play within the hour everything is gone, please fix our not worth playing anymore"
2,"April 3, 2014","Accidentally hitting the back button resets game Why can't they insert an ""Are you sure you want to quit?"" prompt like other games do?

It's extremely disheartening to have all my progress annihilated because I accidentally brushed my palm against the back button.  I really like the different types of auto play they included. In addition to making the game playable (as people already mentioned, to actually play from start to finish is impossible), it's mesmerizing."
1,"April 1, 2014","Blatant plagiarism Directly copied from the Web page of cyberzhg with no optimisation or improvement of any sort, but with ads."
1,"March 29, 2014","Unplayable Hitting one of the buttons right below the board clears the game with no confirmation.   Game would take months or longer to play, but if you leave it and come back it often clears itself."
3,"April 2, 2014","Unrealistic Numerically, if you were to play once a second and get a 4 every time, it would take you over 17 years at minimum."
1,"March 31, 2014",Ads block the screen Funny idea but the ads cut off the screen and force you to click on them by that. Don't bother.
1,"March 29, 2014",Laggy as hell Lags so bad you can't see what's happening and the screen always scrolls down
2,"April 3, 2014",Battery drain Drained 38% of my battery with the screen off. Seriously.
2,"March 28, 2014", Интересно но мешает реклама не вижу внизу цифр. На более мелком девайсе очень маленькие цифры.
5,"March 29, 2014",I did I peed my pants..
1,"April 2, 2014", Not worth to play unless it has save game

2,"April 2, 2014",Fun for a minute But then just gets too much

5,"August 29, 2014","Bigger board = time killer I got the hang of 2048 classic, then tried this. 3 million points later, I can say it's addictive and a good way too pass time. Or lose time. Auto move and the option to change the grid size are nice extras."
2,"March 31, 2015","Waste of time Too easy.  I made it to 16,348 in some discontinues  hours of same day, without loosing and still can go farther.  But I decided to stop playing it and delete it.  Total waste of time"
1,"April 7, 2014",I can't see the tiles You swipe and it looks as though the numbers just slid off the edge of the board. You swipe again and they magically reappear! Is this supposed to be a memory game too? Not to mention the adds cover the bottom row so you can't see them at all.

2,"September 14, 2014","An exponential waste of time Very easy to reach the 2048 tile on an 8x8 board. But by the time you reach the largest tile possible (2^65), you will have stared at your phone for billions of years. Please do not waste your life on this."
5,"December 22, 2014",Too much fun It was so addictive at the 8x8 level that I couldn't stop playing some nights!  I had so much trouble putting my phone down that I had to uninstall it just so I could force myself to get some sleep!  #toomuchfun
2,"November 29, 2014",Its nice game but there is one bug please fix it when you restart the game and click on undo it work  why??even i am not moving a single move otherwise this game is good for timepass
1,"January 15, 2015","Won't download I dint know if it's only my phone but whenever it tries to download,  it says invalid download uri. If you could fix that or tell me what it is, that would be great"
1,"January 22, 2015",Showing adds I don't like apps that cover 1/3 of my screen with advertise on my expense (consuming my data plan) specially when there are similar apps which do exact same function. Developer better find another way to earn money
3,"June 15, 2016","So easy it's a waste of time On a 8x8 board I got to 850k over a matter of days. It's harder to fail than it is to win. The regular 2048 is much more challenging and fun, on a 5x5 square I believe."
1,"October 1, 2015",Removed point of game. This is less a puzzle solving game and more of an endurance event. You could just randomly swipe directions for hours without threat of failure.
5,"November 11, 2015",Pretty awesome. I've been playing the same game since I purchased my phone in April. April.  The. Same. Game.   This is my go to when I need to zone out.
2,"January 24, 2015",Pointless Loved the 4x4 version but the 6x6 grid takes away any challenge. The difficulty comes from lack of room. Just alternate vertical with horizontal swipes and that's it
3,"December 11, 2014",3 stars I love this game but it stops working all the time. I get really far and then its gone the screen goes all black and it dont load anymore. Please please fix this as I dont know what game I like to play more.

2,"November 11, 2016","permissions invasive. asks for files/images access. it's a simple game, no need to 'touch' my files.."
