However, the latter is a bit extreme. The ultimate and tripart modes are virtually impossible. But, I do have a recommendation to make it possible, what you should do is add an option to choose which tile is added for the harder difficulties, because the RNG is brutal when you need that 4 tile to proceed and keep getting a two. Other than that the have is great, don't change anything outside my one complaint and you'll be good."
5,"September 19, 2016",Way too easy I have achieved 2048 in all modes within the same hour I downloaded the game. I understand some peoples minds don't work like mine. But where is there a truely impossible game?
3,"January 16, 2016","Interesting but needs work Seems like a decent idea at first, like a sequel to the original, However it needs some work. Not as smooth as the original and the controls are a little unresponsive. I don't like the idea of people tweaking the ideas of other people to spin their own profit."

The maximum you can get in Ultimate is a score of 172, with the tiles: 32, 16, 8, 4. There is no more room for another tile to spawn at that point, and 4 is the highest number of tile that will spawn. Thus, it is impossible to reach 64, much less 2048. It irks me because I'm a completionist."
3,"May 25, 2015","A little glitchy, but good. I have a 2048 problem, do this game is great for a change of scenery. It often will freeze up or do the wrong action when I swipe."
1,"March 15, 2016",Sucks. How can you even call this a game? I can barely play it because of its trainwreck you call controls. And stamping ads in my face doesn't make it any better!
4,"April 27, 2015","Very fun, great layout. I enjoyed this game while playing it, and I liked the fact that you could have multiple games open and easily switch between them. One possible improvement: It would be even better if you could have multiple games of the same type open at once, though."
4,"October 16, 2015",Fun I like it. Fun twist on the normal 2048 game. My only complaint is occasional gesture accuracy issues.

This would be 4 or 5 stars if an easier/more responsive controls scheme were implemented."
2,"October 20, 2014","Exactly the same If you think about it its literally exactly the same. Except the controls are really fiddly and it often misregisters what you want it to do, there's really no point in getting it if you have 2048."
4,"September 7, 2014","No different This is the exact same game as the original 2048, only stretched. The game isn't a circle but instead a arc. Not a big deal still fun like the original but if your looking for a different strategy game this isn't it."
3,"November 19, 2014",Nice game with flaws..... It's a great concept and very addictive but the accuracy of some of the controls causes unwanted results. Also the tripart and ultimate levels are a bit misleading.  It's both physically and theoretically impossible to attain 2048 on either .
4,"September 24, 2014","Good game Good puzzle game. The controls can be a bit sketchy, but there is a back button so if it makes the wrong move you can go back and try again."
4,"December 21, 2014",Good This is a good break from the same logic from the original game. I must give credit to that as it makes you think a little differently. I would recommend adding more control methods as it can be difficult to use. Thanks for reviving the game for me.
1,"October 9, 2014","Constantly Crashing While I enjoy 2048, the near constant crashing is too much to deal with. I may get a dozen moves before I have to relaunch the app a dozen times to make a single move that sticks."
3,"September 6, 2014","Darn it Once you get into the game it exits. I think the idea is cool and more interesting than the first,  but this glitch needs fixing. IMMEDIATELY!"
4,"December 27, 2014",Change the challenge The rotation changes the strategy. Fun game. Had some glitches and you've got to be careful with your swiping.
3,"December 30, 2014",Controls controls controls The idea of the app is great and it's fun to play but the controls are terrible. Several times during game play the tiles would go in completely the opposite direction of where I swiped them to go.

3,"September 12, 2014",Good idea But the controls are awful. Sometimes I want to rotate the thing and it shrinks instead.
3,"December 17, 2014","Ok for passing time. Not the most challenging, while the one ""ultimate"" board is impossible. It's ok to just mess around with when bored."

4,"September 24, 2014","Good game The game is quite easy compared to the original, but it is very frustrating to win without losing."
2,"September 11, 2014",Nice but unplayable Crashes every few moves such a shame if controls were better and bugs were fixed itd be really fun
3,"September 28, 2014","Gameplay is funny The gestures don't always do what you want it to, they aren't always responsive, and takes a while to get used to."
2,"October 22, 2014",Circular swiping? Swiping not entirely intuitive. Need some form of partial preview to show possible result.
3,"October 24, 2014","OK. It's fun, and satisfyingly complex (in comparison to the usual 2048), but the controls are awkward and messes up the game (it doesn't always do what you want it to)."

4,"December 19, 2014"," Thought it worth a try - the classic version isn't anything different than the standard square - just harder controls.  Playing 'pizza' mode is fun - it's like playing on a 6x3 board, which is a nice change."
5,"January 11, 2015",Its Different!! Try it! This game is most certainly different to the other 2048 games I've played. I can't say why but I'm totally hooked! For those of you who enjoyed other 2048 games I would highly recommend it :-)

2,"August 25, 2014",No effective change in theory If you straighten out the circle *its the same exact game* as the square 2048. Literally you could have the same game play out on both apps and it would get the same results. This is a pretty clever way to have you download another app
4,"August 1, 2014","Not terrible Not having the same crashing problems others are having but controls are a little wonky. Also, it's just the same 2048 game bent, no gameplay difference. Not really worth the control trouble for me but perhaps others will prefer it"

2,"August 21, 2014",Crashing Crashes after 10-15 moves
4,"August 4, 2014", Crashes...seems to have something to do with the graphics...the other versions of this game offer graphics speed settings...might help
3,"August 3, 2014",It's awesome This has a very cool concept but there's still a lot of work for this to be a good game
5,"July 31, 2014",Nice! Works fine on my note 2 (n7100) running a 4.4.4 aosp rom.
1,"August 6, 2014", Controls are not good.
5,"July 28, 2014",Min boggling A wonderful and entertaining game hat exercises the mind
4,"August 1, 2014",Cool Good game fix the force quitting lg p700 custom rom miui
2,"August 25, 2014", The app keeps closing randomly
3,"August 24, 2014"," Great game, but too slow."
1,"July 31, 2014",Hi I cant download.
4,"August 14, 2014",Addictive Fun time killer.  Really like having the different modes.
1,"August 14, 2014", Flashing all the time.
5,"July 30, 2014",Love it Great game works great on my phone. Again great game
2,"August 22, 2014", Great concept but it keeps closing for no reason :(
4,"August 20, 2014", Please improve the controls...
4,"August 4, 2014","360° If it rotate on all rotation, it'd be better"
4,"August 12, 2014",Cool Anyway this game still needing a little improvement
2,"August 11, 2014"," Poor control, otherwise the overall concept is good"
5,"August 4, 2014", Great . I play this & have won for twice !
5,"August 20, 2014",Works good for me I like this version
3,"August 2, 2014", works fine nothing realy new though
5,"August 16, 2014",Very good! Very challenging. I loved it!
5,"August 27, 2014",great game the same but different
5,"August 31, 2014",Good Its very good and efficient
5,"July 28, 2014",Tanishq Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
2,"August 6, 2014", Always stops
4,"July 21, 2014",Amazing Undo only fault
1,"August 10, 2014", omg
2,"August 4, 2014", Mehh
5,"August 6, 2014", Perfect!
3,"August 18, 2014", Cool and rocks
3,"August 21, 2014", Good game
1,"August 4, 2014", Bad
5,"August 15, 2014", Good
1,"August 17, 2014", Good
4,"August 25, 2014", Mmm
5,"August 5, 2014",Nice Nice
5,"June 9, 2014", Loved it
2,"February 14, 2016","Just another 2048 ripoff Circular 2048 tries to be a different and cool ripoff, like hexic 2048. But really, if you look at the circle, its still a 4x4 grid with exactly the same motions. It adds nothing new to the game but a shoddy control scheme."
2,"May 13, 2015","Not good Bad controls, way to many ads, no settings, laggy... I like the concept of this game, it's a really interesting variant to 2048. But the game itself is made poorly. Wasted 10 minutes of my life."
1,"August 2, 2014","It has some problems. The controls do suck. A lot. They are waaay to picky. And the ultimate board should not be in there, because if you think about it, it is basically impossible, if not actually impossible to get past 16. And it is only possible if you get very, very lucky."
2,"August 9, 2014","Lots of issues playing... It's constantly crashing when I play and the controls aren't very responsive. If a better version comes out, I'm definitely going to download it though, as the game's concept is very cool."
1,"September 2, 2014",Not a very well thought out game. Just trying to make 2048 into something that its not to make more money.
3,"August 13, 2014","Fun but... It's a fun game, but it crashes too much. More than half of the open the app, it closes unexpectedly. I wouldn't recommend it if you have a short temper."
4,"September 10, 2014","I don't know it's doing so bad Mine has never crashed. This is a truly great game! More challenging than the first, but in a good way."
1,"August 5, 2014",Crashes way too much!!!  Didn't even have it a full minute before it crashed five times.
3,"September 8, 2014","Meh The idea is cool, but controls dont respond as desired. Also, whrnever I gesture and action, it freezes for a second and updates the UI making no smooth animation or even showing a blank screen for a second."
2,"August 28, 2014","Same game The topology of the board is exactly the same, thus it's the same game. Boring."
2,"November 16, 2014"," The controls are not very well thought out. It might be easier on a bigger screen, but on a droid mini its more frustrating than anything."
3,"August 25, 2014","Fun and challenging I like it, but probably better suited for a tablet, the controls are a bit cumbersome on a small phone screen. Uninstalling for space but I really like this variation of the game"
2,"November 29, 2014"," No different than the original (just bent into a circular shape), but it is harder to make it do what you wanted it to do. Shift inward is often mistaken for a rotation. If the wall wasn't there, then this game would be a genuinely unique variation."
1,"August 5, 2014","Cool idea, but keeps crashing It crashes literally every time I try to make a move."
1,"August 2, 2014",Exactly the same but bad control This game is exactly the same as the square version eccept it is nearly impossible to use the controls well. Whoever thought of this was a sadistic jerk.
2,"January 21, 2015",Good but... The controls suck I was constantly undoing bc it didn't move correctly
1,"July 28, 2014","Couldn't get a response. I installed it on my Z998 and so far it pulls up everything but the actual puzzle, not that anything even so much as recognizes my touch. Even my back and menu buttons did nothing, and it took a couple seconds for home to work. Already uninstalled, maybe reinstallation with WiFi will help."
2,"August 31, 2014", It was definitely not as well thought out as the original. It was very boring.
2,"October 25, 2014",Pathetic execution Horrible controls that don't respond the way they are supposed to. Gets stuck way too often. Irritating pop up ads. Lasted in my phone for an hour before getting uninstalled.
1,"January 8, 2015", The controls do not work the same always. I would prefer the normal one.
1,"October 17, 2014",Better 2048 games out there Was not user friendly.
5,"October 4, 2016",A fun challenge! I love playing with this app when I'm bored. It's an awesome time - waster!
2,"October 26, 2014","Needs tuning Controls are terrible,  and does not distinguish between lines and curves.  Ads are obtrusive, and lag the app severely"
2,"July 22, 2014","Good idea, but poor execution The game idea is very good, but the controls are not easy"
2,"August 25, 2014","No control As said before, good concept but needs major work on how the thing actually moves. Hope to download again in the future if it gets fixed."
1,"August 19, 2014","Difficult control It is exactly the same 2048 game, but more difficult to move..."
2,"September 2, 2014","Ads make it unusable Adverts refresh every second, causing the whole screen to flicker"
1,"November 9, 2014",Adware As soon as I installed this I kept Getting popups out of the game
3,"July 14, 2016",Donlodads pends for a long time im thinking its fun I have 3 apps donloasing but it still pends i think its awsome to me
1,"September 15, 2014",bad sw the circular motion works only 60% of the time
1,"May 14, 2016", I made one move before being interrupted by an ad
1,"December 26, 2014",Badd Its basically a bad version of the original 2048.
1,"August 31, 2014","Crash Crashes too much, un installing for sure"
4,"August 16, 2014",Nice but suck Idea is great but it keeps blinking bit hard to play
2,"March 14, 2016",Hard to control Swiping always does the wrong thing
1,"October 29, 2014",Crashes Crashes every time I make a move.
4,"December 31, 2014"," New perspective, not the best gameplay"
2,"January 9, 2015", Kept crashing every other move
1,"August 6, 2014",Awful! It doesn't worth it!
2,"July 28, 2014"," why does it need access to my photos and external card? Uninstalled after use, doesn't work fluently."
2,"February 11, 2015","Good idea, bad controls... The tiles never move where you want them to."
3,"July 28, 2014",조작감이 너무 않좋아요 칸 수가 많아질수록 조작감이 완전 ㄷㄷㄷ
3,"February 8, 2015", Not the best  but ok
1,"August 9, 2014", This thing keeps crashing
1,"January 14, 2015",One Star It exits the game while playing for no reason
1,"July 24, 2014","Sucks I went to play and every time,i made one,ONE, move before it force closed....."
1,"August 3, 2014",No Freezes a lot!
1,"August 22, 2014",Crash Kept crashing.
5,"November 24, 2014",Good It was a good idea to make this kind of application. I congratulate people made this app.
2,"January 19, 2015",It's hard to move around. I thought the controls would be easier to move the blocks.
3,"December 30, 2014", این بازی برای تمرکز عالی است
5,"January 6, 2015",Not gud game Bakwass hai yee
4,"November 30, 2014", Great game am so addicted. ..
3,"September 3, 2014",OK Dose not let you move the numbers where you want them it is a random thing
4,"November 26, 2016"," This is just a curved ""terraformed"" square matrix"
2,"August 8, 2014", As everyone states controls sucks.
5,"July 19, 2014", So hard to control
2,"January 17, 2015", Not as good as the original
5,"December 12, 2014",Cool Nice one to overcome boredom
5,"January 5, 2015", This thing is best ever
5,"February 5, 2015", ThIs game is awes0me

1,"October 27, 2014", Controls suck dick
2,"August 22, 2014", Hard to control.
