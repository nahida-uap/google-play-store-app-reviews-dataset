1,"September 17, 2017", It's not a game. It's secretly sending invites to our friends in fb without our permission. Report it as spam
5,"September 17, 2017", Excellent game for timepass. U will get addicted to it
1,"September 15, 2017", Game was very good until last update. Now it's asking for login with FB. Why do you do that? I don't use FB and now how can I play? Uninstalling it

Yet there is no multiplayer functionality whatsoever & to add to it, the app has notificatiin spam telling you a friend wants to play against you.

1,"September 3, 2017"," This forcefully sends notifications to other Facebook friends, even after options out of it. Anyways a boring game"
1,"August 30, 2017"," Forced FB login, filled with ads. A poor attempt to sell your email for spam, disguised as a game."

1,"August 10, 2017", Bad apps
5,"August 14, 2017", Never gets boring.
1,"August 10, 2017", Forced Facebook login your losing more players than you realise by doing this even ones with fb. People don't like to be forced to do anything. So add a guest option so people can at least try the game out first. This is far from unreasonable!
1,"August 8, 2017", As best I can tell you can not play this game without connecting with Facebook first.
1,"August 9, 2017", Requires facebook.
