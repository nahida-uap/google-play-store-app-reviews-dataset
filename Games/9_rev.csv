recommendation for the app developer or developers if possible to do an 
update to where not to much ad pop ups but also I don't know if you guys 
also know that the ad's are like as a separate app of its own. Reason for 
me to say that is because when I kill task for any and all apps that are 
open the ad's is it's own window and it also has the little x in the right 
corner of it to weather if you want to close it or keep it open and 
running. Just to let you guys know if you wasn't already aware of it."
5,"June 4, 2018"," Totally addictive. Its not just about matching numbers as they happen. You 
have to make moves to get the numbers where you can match them without 
filling up the board too fast. There's a kind of Rubbicks cube element to 
that for me. Enjoy!"
4,"April 30, 2018"," We will have an interest till we get 2048..... We will also have greater 
than that.. Try to achieve greater numbers.... Do you all know this.....??? 
If we undo many times we can continue the game by dragging Another 
colour....😂😂😂"

2,"March 2, 2017"," While I love the game and how you can change the size of the board and the background color, the fact that every time I closed out of the game or the screen timed out I would have to restart the level. I am uninstalling this game and going to try a different one. It was so very frustrating!"
4,"April 4, 2017", Would have given the game 5 stars. But I have reached a score of over 1 200 000 only to have it reset to a mere 25 000. And this is not the first time my score gets reset. I see a few other users have the same issue. I hope the developer will offer a solution sooner.

I will put my phone down to do something (quickly, while leaving the screen on) and when I pick it back up, my game will be gone. It seems to happen since all of the ads have been put on."
5,"June 27, 2016","Love it. So relaxing & gets your mind off other things.    Only bad part, I Can't Lay IT down. Just one more  game seems to turn in several more. Got a high score in the 55000 s with 2 2048s . Enjoy  it much."
4,"July 26, 2017"," I love the game. I love being able to choose the board size and color scheme. The ads oft times crash the game. After finishing, it oft times freezes, so that I cannot start a new game until I restart my device. Those issues need to be addressed."
3,"December 20, 2016",Love this game BUT Love this game but it automatically erases everything that you've done when I accidentally turn the phone sometimes to landscape. Very frustrating bcz I got a really good score. Other than that it would be 5*
3,"August 5, 2016","Nice game, less Ads would be great! Sudden Video Ads pop up while you play the game. Otherwise nice game, attractive colours and UI. If Ads annoy you, take one without Ads otherwise this is a nice smooth app to use."
4,"October 15, 2017"," Too many bugs. When you minimize the game freezes at times. Couldn't continue with one of my games when reaching 2048. Otherwise, the app is great."
5,"June 8, 2016"," Haven't  had any issues. Don't  like the ads but I  know they are necessary to help pay for costs. Great game to pass the time, lots of fun!"
2,"January 8, 2017","Very Buggy This is a great version of the game, but constant ads and loss of progress are very frustrating. Its to bad there isn't a pro version with save."
5,"April 12, 2016",Amazing Really good and fun but u can only go back once but it's not that big of a deal. I love it though and is really addictive. You can change the colour as well which is cool
5,"September 28, 2016",This shiz is badass I can not stop playing this game. My family is starving and i can't PUT IT DOWN
4,"August 8, 2016",Colorful and relaxing I love it that the tiles come in different colors. The interface feels smooth and fast. At times a little too fast but it's still better than similar games that lag.
4,"May 22, 2016","Like it but has some issues I like the fact of different board sizes, but do not like how it will reset itself and the amount of ads"
5,"February 27, 2017", Its addictive. I have no other words... I would just sit and play when I am bored.
4,"December 2, 2016",Great game Can't find reset button once I've won a game but other than that love it
5,"March 19, 2016","Colerfull Distinctive colors make matching easier.  The default touch sensitivity is very good with a low error rate when swipping.  I've played a couple different versions, and so far, I like this the best."

Hit RESET by accident instead of UNDO on the GAME OVER splash screen, and it resets with NO verify. Fun after 2 weeks and a 7-digit score. Now it plays AUDIO ads to wake sleeping spouses, plus more ads whenever it starts or receives focus. And today, it reset my current 800,000+ game BY ITSELF. I tried to give this a second chance; now it's even WORSE. Use tpcstld's ad-free and bug-free 2048."
5,"February 5, 2016", Great game. Helps with the passing of time. The only problem is by the time you look it's been hours highly addictive awesome my 7 year old loves it and has been learning adding
5,"August 5, 2016",Love this game This is a very addictive game I've run into no issues with glitches or bugs. Hours of fun
5,"October 2, 2017", I really loved the game. You can never stop challenging yourself whenever you play it! I couldn't even concentrate on my work due to it !

4,"May 12, 2017", I really like this app but too many ads and it tends to have a hard time starting a new game once you have played and you want to start another game.
5,"May 12, 2017", Fun and addicting.  No annoying pop-ups!!!
5,"September 9, 2017"," Great, very relaxing. The ads are annoying, but not enough to make me delete the app."
1,"April 4, 2017", Game keeps restarting. Really annoying when your score is over 1.7million. I am going to uninstall it and try another version.
3,"January 20, 2017", I love playing this game.  However during game play it randomly restarts the game back to the beginning which is highly frustrating
1,"March 24, 2016",Shitty Can't exit the game if I do it starts over also why in the world would you place ads in game when the real version doesn't have it it seems like they want you to just download the original
5,"November 16, 2016", How far can you score?  2048 ? well I reached 16384 and still didn't finish the game... so let's see how far can I reach
4,"March 18, 2017"," It gives board sizes uptp 12 unlike many others , along with different themes & tap to undo support . But the tap to undo feature seldom doesn't work . & the loading of the game is slower than others ."
5,"March 26, 2016","This game will give you a disease, it's so SICK!! Mind controlling and too fun....."
3,"May 30, 2017", Good game. A few glitches but doesn't bother me too much.
5,"October 4, 2017", This too addicting for a puzzle lover beware if u are looking for a short break from the program you are writing lol
5,"October 16, 2017"," Really nice game. I like the fact that you can set the board to any size you want. I'll suggest you add more bright colours and also, the undo button should be able to be disabled."
4,"August 2, 2016", It lacks brick colors when after you achieve 2048.
5,"April 26, 2017", It's a awesome game and if U  play with some tricks u can score beyond 2048
5,"March 23, 2017", Great fun! Really hard to put down once you start!
4,"April 27, 2016",Suhas Good except that too many ads. Reached 65536 then it reset it self to start.
5,"October 6, 2016",Nice game ever made The less ads made us feel enjoy now I 'm giving 5 stars because of the game quality.This should be the best game of 2048 from the others.
5,"April 4, 2016","BEST GAME EVER!! Liked it because you can go more than 2048 and my recent number is 16348 and my score is more than 150000, and you can undo, try bigger and smaller sizes!"
