recommendation for the app developer or developers if possible to do an 
update to where not to much ad pop ups but also I don't know if you guys 
also know that the ad's are like as a separate app of its own. Reason for 
me to say that is because when I kill task for any and all apps that are 
open the ad's is it's own window and it also has the little x in the right 
corner of it to weather if you want to close it or keep it open and 
running. Just to let you guys know if you wasn't already aware of it."
5,"June 4, 2018"," Totally addictive. Its not just about matching numbers as they happen. You 
have to make moves to get the numbers where you can match them without 
filling up the board too fast. There's a kind of Rubbicks cube element to 
that for me. Enjoy!"
