a direction that doesn't have any matches, it counts that as a move, and

a direction that doesn't have any matches, it counts that as a move, and 
then you can't get an undo. That means you might have to swipe in direction 
you didn't want to. Worse, if there are no other moves, it ends the game 
without letting you take back the last move! This is no big deal on the big 
boards where you'll never make it there with proper play. The largest 
possible tile in 6x6 is 137 billionâ€¦ But on smaller boards you have to be 
able to undo the last move to get a 4, to get the highest possible tile. 
Ruins the game for me. I also wish you could turn off the confirmation for 
undo last move."

Let me know when you move the undo button I may come back. Also you may want to put in an undo last undo button. May save people from getting pissed off.

MILLION points and was three spots away from combining to the highest 
number, still going strong (was playing on the 8x8 grid) when my finger 
bumped the New button. Lost EVERYTHING. I'd been playing that one game off 
and on every day for literally WEEKS. My suggestion? Next update, put an 
""Are You Sure?"" prompt that comes up when the New button is touched."
