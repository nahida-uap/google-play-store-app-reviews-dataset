2,"April 10, 2016",Not responsive Swipe and no response. Makes it very frustrating when you have to do the same move several times before the app figures it out.
2,"May 11, 2016",Slow extremely slow comparing to other 2048 apps. :(
2,"April 19, 2016"," Unresponsive to swipes, seems laggy"
1,"December 28, 2015", Attention developer: needs a setting to just continue after 2048 and not prompt the user to continue or start new game
5,"February 12, 2016",Excellent Awesome game of puzzle...

5,"April 5, 2015", Amazing game
5,"September 10, 2014","Easy, Fast, and Challenging Most importantly, you can play it in one hand.  Closest comparison I can think of that I have is ""Fives"".  I love Fives, but I like this far more because of how accessible it is, and the move mechanics remind me of Tetris.  Very fun, definitely a keeper."
5,"October 30, 2014",Original one.. Really great
3,"February 25, 2016","Annoying touch sensitivity Same basic premise of classical game. But the touch interface in my phone (Moto G) killed the mood. I have to swipe multiple times to make a move. There should be a setting for that, or a better calibration for other devices"
4,"July 14, 2018"," The problem is lot of ads are coming while playing the game even if my 
Internet connection is off. So please if possible remove these ads"

1,"January 30, 2018"," Advertisement comes inbetween are vulgar, abusive."
5,"November 11, 2017", My highest score on this version is a 970980 and still game aint over yet. Highest tile of 65536.
