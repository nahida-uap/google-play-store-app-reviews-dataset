Would it be possible to implement a single corner auto mode instead of, or in addition to, the current method of moving focus to another corner? I'd like for it to simply stop if it can't make any moves closer toward the chosen corner. It would really help me to keep it organized, as I can't stop it fast enough to keep it focused even on ""Very Slow""."

5,"January 5, 2018", I love this game. Great time waster. Not addictive. But-please consider changing the daily and weekly scoring to accommodate points gained per day/week. Thank you :)

3,"June 14, 2017", Undoing the last step is an essential part of the game mechanics of 2048. Limiting it is like only allowing 20 left swipes... otherwise good game.
4,"July 16, 2017"," I don't mind - too much - the ad up in the left corner offering undos for installing a game, but every time it flashes, the game play hiccups for a split second. Annoying. Please fix!"
