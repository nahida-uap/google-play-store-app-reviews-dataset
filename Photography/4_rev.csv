HOWEVER randomly popping up advertising in particular when you do not have the app open is just more then annoying.  I more then happily would pay (but not a subscription payment) for the app if that would mean that I have no longer advertising popping up. Even when trying to exit the app you are forced to click away various adverts before actually able to close the app. Shame really as I do like the app but until I can get an advertising free version it is uninstalled from my devices.

Plus, when you add texture or want to use any of the very many really cool effects, these effects don't have a name or a number attached m, so you try one then have to scroll black to the beginning if you want to click on original to see a difference and then if you like the one effect you have tried, you have to TRY to find it somehow from so many unnamed ones effects! Pain, thus is an absolute pain. And every time you want to try to collage another photo you get pop ads... I know the app is for free but... It's very annoying and takes a long time to do something if you want to try different effects before finding the one you like."
