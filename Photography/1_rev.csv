5,14-Jul-18," I honestly dont know why this app is free, but I'll take it. With a bit of 
a learning curve it is an amazing tool box for editing images. It's been 
useful for all sorts of art projects as well. I use it a lot and I have no 
complaints"
3,13-Jul-18," I'll give 5* when i get the option to buy out the dang ads...... I love the 
app been using it for years now, but the ads are just ridiculous. Let me 
buy the app and ditch the ads please..."

process and whatnot... it stays in a like Instagram Square and wont show 
the other stuff"

it. Please fix this issue ASAP. No complaints are being addressed by pixlr"

of use is what I love about it. Simple yet effective!"
3,14-Jul-18," Everything is just ok. Not able to save collage photo. Need to add some 
more effect."
1,17-Jul-18," This app is extremely limited in what it can do. Can't erase backgrounds, 
add in multiple images or use layers, etc. Very low quality app for very 
limited specific uses."

too. The drawbacks that I come across while using the application is that I 
can enter only one text at one time. There should be an option of adding 
more than one. This allows to be more free with the edits. Else it becomes 
annoying a bit. On PicsArt, one can add multiple texts, stickers, call 
outs, draw things etc. If the developers could work on this, it would be 
really great! Thankyou!"
1,29-Jun-18," Used to be the best editor, now it's broken. Whenever you try to add text, 
the bottom menu turns into a blank black box and you're stuck. Can't do 
anything after that. Tried reinstall, it's just broken."

my phone and the first I install when ever I get a new phone. I also use 
the desktop version on my laptop which makes editing a lot faster with 
exactly the same features and more. Thanks team Pixlr for one of the top

The stickers are super cheesy and outdated designs imo. Basic photo editing 
it works."

of serious issues. I can't dowload any sticker packs, previews are blurry, 
and worst of all, I can't share pictures - clicking More doesnt let me 
choose the sharing app but immediately tries to post to Facebook! I don't 
use Fb. Clearing default doesnt help."
4,22-May-18," It's OK. I've been using it for years. It never changes though. Never any 
new stickers, frames, or, well, anything."
5,18-Apr-18," Thanks a lot. Original typing came back after today's update. Once again 
thanks."
3,17-Apr-18," Was a 5 star app before the text feature was messed up... I love using it 
to add text to my photos but until it's fixed I won't be anymore. EDIT: The 
new update did not fix this issue, as I hoped it would. PLEASE allow text 
to be rotated again!"
4,17-Apr-18," This has been my ATF photo editor for YEARS until yesterday. Not sure what 
exactly was ""fixed"" because now it's a huge mess. Deleting, sorry!!"
3,18-Apr-18," After the update, all the special effects filters are gone.I don't know if 
its a app prob or a phone prob."
3,22-Apr-18," I am not able to download any of the filters or stickers even though I have 
an internet connection and storage.!!!!"
5,18-Apr-18," Need font update for local languages like telugu hindi such like plz make a 
favour we are short movie makers so plz help us in such issue which we are 
facing"
5,21-Apr-18," I have rated 5 stars in this app One thing you should update that is you 
should add more fonts in pixlr which will help many youtube content 
creators like me if this happen it will be the best app"
5,18-Apr-18, So glad you fixed the text issue. Was the worst 2 weeks without this spp.
5,17-Apr-18, Would you kindly make it possible to pay to get rid of the ads?
4,19-Apr-18, Thank you for new update now text issue is resolved :)

After a single edit, like adding text to a photo, all the editing option ""buttons"" disappear and I cannot get them to return. It makes the app basically unusable in its current state. Please fix this issue or revert it back to its previous state, please. I don't want to have to find another editing app."
3,11-Apr-18," Was FANTASTIC til update! Now RUINED! Harder to use, can only type text in lines and not drop to separate lines!  Been using from day 1, but now, maybe time to look elsewhere! Revert back to as it was, MUCH better as it was."
5,13-Apr-18," It's a good app and I've had it before. However, it is not showing me any of the stickers or effects, none of it is loading. It also keeps telling me to check my connection, but I have been and it's just fine."
3,13-Apr-18," The damn thing won't let me download my filters! My network is fine and I 
have more than enough room. I don't know why they won't load/download"
3,11-Apr-18," Before the update it was awesome, but after this update it is unable to download the various font styles, shows ""error downloading the pack, check network settings and storage space"" while I have lots of space and very fast internet connection.  Please check the matter."
5,14-Apr-18," Absolutely love the app.  The only thing I am having trouble with is the text.  Since the last update, the text part is having issues."
1,15-Apr-18," You have ruined the app. The text is destroyed as only one line can be 
typed. You cant press enter to go to second line. Other menu options are 
NOW not user friendly. Fire the person who suggested the changes."
5,12-Apr-18," I love this app so much. Actually, i use this only to edit my pic. But i had discovered that you can also use this app to make artworks, like anime stuff. Love it. The best things about this application is that everything is free"
4,11-Apr-18," This has been my go to photo editor for years...totally love it! Lots of options and it's easy to use. Would have given 5 stars, but all my favorite fonts are gone! Why? Will they be back?"
1,16-Apr-18," Why did you remove the ""ENTER "" option that used to allow to enter in next line.. now its like, we have to write line by line.. not al all good  . Very disappointed."
4,13-Apr-18," This is my favorite photo editing app on mobile by far, but why does the enter button not go to the next line when adding text suddenly? It was great to make original memes but now I might have to find another app."

but otherwise, nothing beats it."

it finis the typing section rendering program useless e-mail suplyer do not 
help as they don't answer you back you went from the best in the marked to 
the worst my new rating not even a star worth"
3,11-Apr-18," I thought it was great, but now I can't use the enter button to create a seperate line when using text, its just one long stream now. I will have to look for another app now."
5,16-Apr-18, My teacher showed us this. I know when your in comparison class all you want to do is play games but out of the things they have made us do this is at the top!!
4,17-Apr-18," It's a really awesome app but for some reason it doesn't let me download 
the ""packs"" even tho I have good Internet connection and more than enough 
space"
2,17-Apr-18," This was my favorite editing app until the latest update rendered the 
ability to skip to the next line of text null and void. Please fix when you 
can so I can go back to usage"
4,16-Apr-18," I absolutely love this app EXCEPT it would be so mich better if we had more options for the double exposure layer, such as flipping and unlocking the aspect ratio so it could be a little more customized."
4,14-Apr-18," I totally agree with the last review, I love this app and have been using 
it for the last few years, but I am having the same problem with the text 
and really don't want to find another app instead of. Please can it be 
fixed !"
2,17-Apr-18," Can't press enter for a new line on text was working fine last week can 
anyone help?"
4,13-Apr-18," It was perfect before the update. When I enter my texts now, to move the cursor to the next line, the complete text goes to the main page in a complete line. I hope you can fix this fast...."
4,13-Apr-18, The new update screwed it up. The pictures are going pixelated so I can't make anything out. fix it
4,17-Apr-18," Great app. Would like to see an option for transparency. Maybe smoother 
resizing for images below 500px. Latest update (3.3.2) doesn't seem to play 
well with immersion mode for me."
5,12-Apr-18," This app is amazing for editing, very powerful. And thank you to the developers for listening to the people who paid for the ad free version"
4,16-Apr-18," Looks great and has a lot of fun features and options. But you cant play 
with specific color saturation and hue in general"
1,13-Apr-18," The older version was awesome, i can't use the next line for the text the 
enter button doesn't allow to me to type in the next line please fix this."
2,16-Apr-18," Fix the text issue on the last update!! I can't drop to a separate line no 
longer."
3,11-Apr-18," When I try to add a Text to a photo, it always turns out blurry"
1,17-Apr-18," Whatever you did to it you lost me. 3 years. It will not seperate lines and 
makes one long sentence. I am done with it."
5,12-Apr-18," I really like this app, but with this new update when I reinstalled the app, ako packages fails to download now I can't use the app on its full potential pls reply back what to do with this"
4,14-Apr-18," Very good app for editing pictures, but you could add a fearure where 
instead of saving the pictures as .jpg they would save as .png"
2,11-Apr-18, It's not allowing to save photos in gallery aftwr editing. Crashes afterwards - Lg G5

2,14-Apr-18, So the last update was cool and all with how it looks but the text feature has messed up the app. It can only write in 1 line.
5,15-Apr-18," Only thing this app needs to make it the best is the ability to arc text. 
Are you listening, pixlr devs??"
1,27-Apr-18, How do you shrink text so it all fits
1,13-Apr-18, I think it is the worst do not NOT get this app
3,17-Apr-18, I am not able to download the stickers package
1,13-Apr-18," Enter key not working. Please, fix this problem."
1,11-Apr-18, Why enter key is not tapping it down to next line while adding text!!! It just closes the text !!!
5,11-Apr-18," Thanks for adding ""restore purchases"", now the app does not have 
advertising because I previously paid to remove ads."
2,14-Apr-18," Well this app was great but then all of a sudden I can't download the other 
packages that the app hasüò¢"
1,16-Apr-18, I needed to add words to a picture. This app doesn't allow me to choose size and/or placement of my text.
3,14-Apr-18," Uninstalled immediately was just trying to cover sensitive data and this 
app is definitely not fit for such simple purpose"
1,17-Apr-18, This app has been ruined
2,15-Apr-18, New text feature messed it up.
5,11-Apr-18, Downloaded into new device. Would love to have more calligraphic fonts instead of the present which includes a lot of fonts that are too similar.
5,15-May-18," Best photo editor so far It's so handy to make a cover for books on wattpad 
and a great editor for some photos too."
3,29-Apr-18," It's amazing but it's better if Arabic fonts were available. I hope you can 
add it to Pixlr"
3,17-Apr-18," Text inputing is not working &and also add some function for converting png 
file into jpg."
4,16-Apr-18," I downloaded fonts on there but end up with the same fonts. They're are the 
same! What's going on?"

1,4-Apr-18," Its been 4 years, but the performance is still dismal... Shame. Great filters and effects, however, the app takes FOR EVER to load the pictures. There's gotta be a better way to cache photos and make this app move faster..."
1,4-Apr-18," I've been using pixlr for a long time now but for some reason it won't let me save my photos anymore after I edit them, as soon as I click done it gives a brief error message saying it cannot be saved and the app closes. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but nothing seems to work."
4,21-Mar-18," Thanks for fixing the issues. Especially the problem i was facing where i wasn't able to save my work. The new UI/buttons look good. I'm not able to download the ""Pride pack 2"" in stickers menu.  Also, new fonts would be appreciated. Thank you."
5,31-Mar-18, Changing my score for this app back to a perfect 5/5 because the glitch was fixed. Thanks Pixlr team for hearing us out! Love this app. It's the best photo editing app Ive downloaded on Android!
5,27-Mar-18," I love this app! I use it a lot, but you should add a recoloring feature. I can't find good recoloring apps anywhere, so I can't change up the pictures I want to change. Pls add one."
2,10-Apr-18, Cropped images do not save as the set resolution. The saved image is several times over smaller than the set resolution & the quality very poor. It used to work all well before.
2,26-Mar-18, Worst app. I don't know why it's rating are high. PicsArt provide more features & effects than this
1,25-Mar-18," Paid to remove ads, but there are still ads. Their support refuses to respond. Thieves! I want my money back. Zero Stars!"
2,30-Mar-18, Why would you remove fonts that i have been using for years? Why touch something that works. I went to ad my favorite font and it's no longer there. Please help me find that font. How do i get in touch with your customer service?
4,21-Mar-18," Love this ap and used it for a while without issue, recently tho, when I try to save a picture that I've edited, it becomes pixelated as soon as I press save. And the picture becomes blurred."
1,27-Mar-18, Sliders do not show adjustments until lifting up on the sliders. Takes me back to late 1990's digital photo processing. Highlights and shadows adjustments are phony. Nope.
5,26-Mar-18, This App Is Amazing Please Add The Layer Window For More Outstanding Editing I Was Using This App Since 1 Year And Its Become Now My Routine App Please Please Add Layer Window To Create Best Ideas  I Love This App
5,25-Mar-18, Hey! I really love this app. I was using it for editing pictures only but a few days back I tried your camera function and I was amazed at how detailed pictures it can capture. It is way more better than my stock camera.
4,29-Mar-18," Great all around app, but cannot handle HIGH QUALITY photos (10+MB), when using splash option it will take away color from some objects that were supposed to keep color."
5,29-Mar-18," A nice clean app that doesn't require loads of irrelevant permissions and doesn't take up a ton of space. Would like option to curve text, but perfect other than that!"
4,3-Apr-18, Fabulous range of effects considering the limitations of working on a touchscreen phone. Would just like to see a hardness/opacity option for the brush/eraser  on the double exposure feature to really excell.
5,8-Apr-18, I've been searching high and low for an app that lets me add fun to my pictures and Pixlr was perfect for the job. I was even able to add arabic text and not have it ruined. Love it already!
5,8-Apr-18, I use this app EVERYDAY!! My Galaxy just did an update and now A LOT of the fonts I had dont work anymore!  PLEEEEEASE fix this issue. I love this app so much!!
1,4-Apr-18," No response to my support request. I paid for full version but still seeing ads even with latest version, unacceptable."
4,7-Apr-18, I am looking for powerful alternative of Picsart and finally I found !  Just one feature very commonly use. Flat border of same color to make objects or texts looks smaller inside big flat backgroubd. It is the inverse of trimming. Waiting your response and new update. Many thanks
2,4-Apr-18, I can't save photos after applying effects. App stops and crashes everytime I try to save photos. Please fix this issue....
5,28-Mar-18," Overall, this app is great. I do have a major issue with the app resetting in the middle of working, thereby losing all my work."
1,21-Mar-18, U destroyed this wonderful app for many years this app was my favorite. Now is really ugly with the new update.. üòß
4,8-Apr-18," I like it. It's a pretty rich photo editor. I'd really love if it had a ""Curves"" adjustment like in Photoshop. Also, I'd like to see more monospace fonts as they are the ones I use most. If these features got added, then Pixlr would definitely be my go-to mobile photo editor."
3,31-Mar-18, Childish... Too basic. Uninstalled.
5,22-May-18," BEST EDITOR APP EVER! YOU DONT NEED TO PAY, YOU JUST HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT! 
GOOD WORK... DOWNLOAD THIS GUYS... I RECOMMEND THIS APP TO EVERYONE! 5 
STARS FOR ME ‚ù§"
4,21-Mar-18, I'm so glad they finally updated the doodle feature! It was the only flaw but with the most recent update can't find anything that isn't great.   I never leave reviews and opened it just to come make this one! So thanks!
5,28-Mar-18," I love it!!! The only thing I would change is to be able to change opacity and blend edges in doodle mode, but other than that, it's an amazing app!!"
2,7-Apr-18," Can no longer share to whatsapp as it keeps asking if I want to over write the image and no matter what I choose, it keeps going round in circles.Will share to Facebook and twitter though. Uninstalling after years of use"
1,8-Apr-18, this is an awful app it should be more like the computer version where you can move parts of the photo in the right angle enlarge things .also remove the background
1,23-Mar-18," Please fix the font resolution. When I enter the font on picture it gets low resolution (bad pixels). If I take font on 3 times in the same picture, it is really gets bad pixel size with low resolution. Please fix font resolution problem."
2,1-Apr-18, Couldn't have basic drawing features like adding a rectangle or circle inside picture. Also adding text to a picture has very limited options. Uninstalled
4,30-Mar-18, How can I get rid of the ads? (I'm sure I actually paid something once to do this but if I did they're back). Very irritating.
2,5-Apr-18," I wish I were writing a better review because overall the app is simple and easy to use. It just doesn't do the one thing I need it to do, which is add edges to an image to make it square."
3,25-Mar-18, So..guys.. u copied things from snapseed application..see ua customers are too much sharp..n u copied their style..n the thing is..copied things are not that much well...so...try new things fr ua good n fr customers.
2,3-Apr-18, Crashes too much. Only able to use the very simple tools.
5,9-Apr-18, I really enjoy this editing app. Out of all of them this one is the easiest and has more variety as to what you can actually do.
1,29-Mar-18, It doesnt let you add another picture i believe the computer is better than the app
4,23-Mar-18, Awesome app just wish they would update their stickers and such for current holidays
4,5-Apr-18," I have trouble downloading the ""Pride 2"" sticker pack, which is really unfortunate."
3,2-Apr-18, Low quality photos after all the editing. I just wasted my time.
3,2-Apr-18," I would give this 5 stars, but not until it stops stripping EXIF data. Huge downside."
1,24-Mar-18, Cannot open jpg files.  Actually pretty useless.
5,1-Apr-18," I just wish all the features are ready to use, and not have to download them separately. Like the font styles, etc. Just have them all ready upon installation. Thanks anyway"
2,21-Mar-18," As an ""express"" photo editor it's ok, but I wish it was as robust as the desktop version with layers and all the bells and whistles."
5,9-Apr-18," Finally image scaling (resolution) and export format at hand, not just cropping! Only idiot developers may think I'm fine with sharing 4 MB photos!"
1,29-Mar-18, Downloaded just for text feature. It was terrible.
1,2-Apr-18, I read the licence agreement and it sounded scary. I thought it read free?

5,13-Apr-18," It is a great editor/creator for collages and photos,there are many templates tochoose from and a whole bunch ofother options to use"

5,7-Apr-18," Works as expected, I especially use the straighten, vertical, horizontal & rotate features. Thank you."
4,25-Mar-18," Love the new update, but now when text is saved it becomes pixilated. Please fix!"

4,28-Mar-18, Plsss add new effect
1,21-Mar-18," As someone that previously paid for the app, how do you remove the ads?"
1,1-Apr-18, I was expecting the feature fromyour web application  of selecting areas of photo and applying custom color that is missing
5,29-Mar-18, It is an amazing app. But i would really like it if there were more calligraphy stickers.
5,31-Mar-18," sy nyaman dgn aplikasi ini, versi web mwpun ponsel"
