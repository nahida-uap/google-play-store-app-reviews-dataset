3,"June 18, 2018"," Way too many ads. Not get easy to navigate. I finally figured out how to do 
what I wanted, but the process was cumbersome. I'll probably try a 
different app."
3,"June 11, 2018"," There are better apps for color splash. Can't zoom in enough for fine 
detailing, leaves your photo looking amateurish and unfinished."
1,"May 18, 2018"," 3 pop up ads just loading 1st pic... It just removed all color and let's 
you ad original colors back in... No color alteration capability!"
1,"June 29, 2018"," Too many ads... sometimes, if i use vpn... it will crash.. this app 
sucks... i would like to zero rate this app if i can"
5,"June 18, 2018"," This is a great way to add a pop of color to your edits, and even comes 
with its own features! I love everything about this app. I would, however, 
request that we be able to soon into the image while adding color, it would 
just make the process a lot easier."
4,"May 14, 2018"," Too many ads pppl. It is really a shame, nice app but not gonna take all 
that cr@p with the ads sorry."
5,"June 1, 2018"," Great app. Why spend money on expensive camera. Just use this app to edit 
photos"
1,"June 26, 2018", Way too many ads. Can't do anything without an ad popping up
3,"June 27, 2018"," To many ads - a new ad came up in between each step of editing my photo. 
Very distracting"
4,"June 11, 2018"," Initially this is great and easy to use. I can easily grey out the photo 
and color the parts that I wish. Could do with far less ads. But...I get 
it. We all get it."
5,"June 2, 2018"," Does what it promises, why complain about the ads when you get a free 
service? Good app!"
1,"May 11, 2018", Very bad app plz don't install this app It contains lots of adds
1,"May 22, 2018"," Horrible the ADDS too many way too many...then the lock screen...no thank 
you...don't use this app!!"
4,"June 2, 2018"," It's good, but takes a while to work some things out and constant 
interruptions of ads is terrible"
3,"June 4, 2018"," Too many ads is the only complain. Like ads every 10 secs!...editor is 
awesome like super awesome!!"
1,"May 15, 2018", Silly app. No inteligent editing. Very simple core with many useless options
1,"June 3, 2018"," S P A M ... ADS ARE EVERWHERE.... TOTOALLY USELESS...These Apps illustrate, 
Google Ratings SUCK... Google Play does not care about quality."
4,"June 12, 2018"," its good but it will be a lot better if it can zoom more so the picture 
doesnt look amateurish, tq!"
5,"May 12, 2018"," Very easy to use and the pictures come out amazing. Definitely one of my 
favorite photo apps."
1,"June 16, 2018", You can't zoom in. Adds every few seconds. Not great.
5,"July 2, 2018"," OMG!!!!! I didn't expect this app to be that awesome....completely 
amazing....by the name u will thought that it only let u colour 
splash...noo there are more things which u didn't ecpect in this size 
app....awsm app...best thing i hv dwnloaded in 2018 so far....üëç‚ù§‚ù§"
5,"June 20, 2018"," What a great app. The only thing it needs is a color choosing pallet. I 
want to add a bright color or change a color"
5,"June 1, 2018"," Very interesting application and quite helpful in photo editing. Easy to 
use and fun."
1,"May 31, 2018", So many pop ups I couldn't use it and then it crashed
2,"June 7, 2018"," Ads pop up and take you out of app but make it seem like you're supposed to 
fill out things for your app"
4,"June 8, 2018"," This app is very good and usefull. There is only one issue, it is hard to 
get it exact. But I guess that is my own fault."
1,"June 4, 2018"," The app itself is ok, but just too many ads!"
4,"June 6, 2018"," It's good But too many ads but as long as I get my picture edited it's all 
good :)"
1,"May 13, 2018"," Terrible, basically ad spam. Its literally so full of ads it is not even 
functional."
5,"May 11, 2018", Love it the best I've used so far two thumbs up for sure.
3,"June 25, 2018", Its OK I just can't stand all the ads
5,"May 30, 2018"," Color splash has helped me create magical moments! I've grateful to it! 
Thanks team Color Splash!"
4,"May 13, 2018"," It's worth the time, getting to add text, memes, making your own online 
photos look old, it's great for fun with friends or family. And yes even 
boyfriend's."
5,"July 9, 2018"," Just started, got few shots done but simplistic and works well."
4,"May 27, 2018"," I do love the app and ease of use, but, the pop ups get a bit much. 
Otherwise, a great app!!"
2,"June 17, 2018", Not as good at coloring in color as some other apps
1,"May 23, 2018", Pathetic. This app is a giant advert page
3,"June 25, 2018", Every time I go to edit it tells me to restart app.
1,"June 2, 2018", Toc app. Pathetic filled with stupid adds and hangs.
5,"July 17, 2018", Could do with a greater zoom to get into awkward spots
1,"June 2, 2018", Ads overload. Can't even use it.
1,"May 11, 2018", Worst ad experience of any app I've ever tried
3,"May 31, 2018", Ads are a headache and this app has lot of them
1,"May 25, 2018", Just awful. Everything you hit links to another app. Useless.
1,"June 13, 2018"," This app is LITERALLY a copy and paste of another Photo Editor app. Only 
difference is that it's specifically a Color Splash of that app's setting."
1,"May 24, 2018"," Can't figure how to even change the color selection! No help menu. Tons of 
ads."
4,"May 23, 2018", It takes a while to get used to
5,"June 30, 2018"," Dope ass app, loved the smart color and free color. Looks awesome and is 
easy to use. Wish iyt had less ads tho üòä"
5,"July 9, 2018", Very good and easy use the app....
1,"July 10, 2018"," Only add, not able to edit images"
1,"May 18, 2018", Rediculous amount of ads totally annoying
4,"June 20, 2018"," Great app, a little hard to use on the phone without a stylus though. üòÖ"
1,"July 17, 2018", it is so bad it doesnt zoom at all
1,"June 11, 2018", Minus rating and zero point for this app.worst
3,"May 26, 2018"," Fun tools for my pictures, just a lot of annoying ads."
5,"May 19, 2018", Luv it but hate da adds
5,"July 5, 2018"," Its great, but 1 more thing it should be have zoom in and out option when 
editing...."
5,"June 23, 2018"," Good app,except for loud pop ups!"
2,"June 7, 2018", Way too many ads.
1,"June 23, 2018"," Couldn't even use the app. By the time u get through all the adds the app 
stopps working."
5,"June 22, 2018", Great app but aur have been better with fewer ads
2,"June 11, 2018", The ads ruin the experience out of the box.
5,"June 3, 2018"," Great fun app, lots of ads but not a big deal. Works better with a stylist 
pen."
5,"July 16, 2018"," I absolutely love this. Lots of fun. And it brings so much life to your 
pictures. Glad I downloaded it! ;)"
3,"June 15, 2018", Way too many ads
1,"June 26, 2018", Was way too much click bait right out the opening of the app...uninstalling
4,"July 10, 2018"," Not bad! I really like this app. Give this app a chance, you may not be 
disappointed."
5,"June 30, 2018", I hate it when it refuses to work
2,"July 4, 2018", Its not so good
5,"July 3, 2018", Good and useful app
5,"June 16, 2018"," Have used this app for around 10 years. Probably ly one of the best out 
there"
5,"July 2, 2018"," Best professional photo enhancing, editing app completely free and hardly 
any adds!"
5,"June 4, 2018", Can't be more amazing
3,"May 13, 2018"," It's not about us ,it's all about your app ,do something something else"
4,"June 18, 2018", Not a bad app only that tracing an image isn't that perfect
5,"May 28, 2018", The app was is the greatest. Loved it‚ù§Ô∏è
5,"June 25, 2018"," Really good I recommend this app if u r a good photographer and want to 
make some corrections"
1,"May 16, 2018", If watching ads was the aim this app is for you
5,"May 24, 2018"," Aaaaahhh! Nice application , good edits . But it take time to understand 
and use it."
5,"June 23, 2018"," App is good , but ads in between irritates"
5,"July 12, 2018"," It's amazing. It helped me out a lot, so thank you! üòÅ"
