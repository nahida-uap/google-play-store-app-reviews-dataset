5,"December 10, 2017"," I try out lots of photo apps and this app has quickly moved into my top 5 favorites. The only bad downside is that I cannot stop having fun with it. So if you can develop an app to take care of my kids, cook dinner and clean my house I would appreciate being notified asap!!"
1,"September 1, 2017", At first it was so nice with filters but now it takes you back to your phone camera and no stickers whatsoever. What could be wrong? ??
4,"October 30, 2017", This app is way better than any other app I could find... This is an amazing app... There is just a few things that need to be sorted out otherwise it's like the best camera app eva 😀
1,"August 8, 2017", It won't let me take a picture to put a filter om it and none of the things on the app barely work I don't know if it is the electronic I'm using but I know that there shouldn't be any thing wrong with the electronic
3,"September 9, 2017", I liked it a lot but edit for the fact that it crashed when I tried to use live camera selfie mode that bug needs fixing but assist from that is great so plz download if Snapchat or msqrd is your kind of thing
4,"October 21, 2017", A little difficult to use at first. Then I enjoyed it.

5,"November 12, 2017"," It's a rlly good photo app. U may think it's just stickers that u have to fit but actually its kinda another version of snap chat but it's not social media, that's all . 😊"
1,"September 2, 2017", Full of pop ups and half the time the camera function isn't  available to even use. Waste of time don't bother

2,"October 25, 2017", It just crashed as soon as I tried ANY filters! 😥
4,"December 8, 2017", It's good. But for dark textures you can't brighten them with lighter colors.
3,"August 13, 2017"," This app is nice I think people should download it, it doesn't take a lot of space and takes good pictures"
5,"January 10, 2018", It helps me with ugly pics and pics with bad lighting
5,"October 27, 2017"," I love the choices on here, just wish you could change the backgrounds and change your eye color and hair. But I really do love this app."
4,"January 11, 2018", It is oky but it shows that it can filter but on my it dont want to filter but everway it is cool that it can blur and do al short of things
1,"October 24, 2017", It doesn't satisfy me what I want
1,"October 13, 2017", Glitches badly can never take a photo
4,"October 1, 2017", Nice app very useful but It can't be linked with google but It's an enjoying app I like to use this
