With that in mind, deleting based on the fact it's nothing special, and because of limitations being free, you must hit the back button 6x to exit app based on ads and UI. Ridiculous. Save yourself the hassle and exit with the home button. Limits picture size greatly, so free version has no use to me. Nothing stood out in features. Before and after view is useless due to sidebar blocking everything on the right. Shrink photo a bit and move to bottom!!"
1,"April 21, 2015",Would have given a 5 but... It crashes every time I try to open a photo that I had put on my phone from my camera. Too high quality or what?
