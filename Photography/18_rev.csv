open apps you see a window named ""ad"".. this pops up blocking you from 
using the app you wanted to you. And also they have these bubble popups 
that sit around on the screen while your using other apps... The only way 
to stop this is to force close the app or ununstall.. I still plan to try 
it for it's photo features, but will be force closing Everytime I'm done I 
guess...sad"
1,"June 23, 2018"," Worst photo app ever I understand having ads in the app but even when not
