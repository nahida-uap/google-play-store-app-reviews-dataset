duplicate photo mainly using the drawing tool. I need a suitable stylus for 
my Tablet's screen because it was a bit difficult getting the color to take 
even on zoom which is a great option! Looking forward to getting better 
aquainted with all the options. Just wondering if I can delete the multiple 
dulicated photos? üòâ"
5,"May 23, 2018"," At present I have only just started using your App so cannot comment as 
much as I would like. However, I often alter my photos having been a 
professional in a past life so to find an App which appears to do what I 
need is very important. I will rate again after a while."
4,"June 13, 2018"," Literally downloaded and a minute later I'm being asked to rate it. I need 
time to know lol I don't want to give false information to the creator or 
potential users. The one picture I have played with let me be able to tell 
you I like your options. Seem to be many."
4,"May 12, 2018"," It's a great app. Definitely will keep it but in the part where you choose 
the photo it is semi laggy. Fix the lag and I will give 5 stars. P.s. 
blemish tool works properly unlike many other photo editors so I'm very 
happy with this app."
1,"February 19, 2018", Downloaded this app a few days ago and it is littered with ads! While inside other apps - the ads interupt EVERYTHING and you can't exit them till the ad disappears.  Consider this app a bust
4,"May 26, 2018"," Since I'm a newbie to photo editing, I'm spending a lot of time exploring 
the different aspects of this app. So far, it does what I need. I've tried 
a lot of other photo editing apps and they either had too many ads, were 
too complicated or didn't do what I needed. Thanks."
4,"May 19, 2018"," Fun. Easy to use. Variety of different things you can do..small variety 
tho. Have to say although I like it, I have seen better editing apps. But 
this is one of the keepers...so far!"
5,"April 7, 2018"," Thank you for an app where you can adjust the simple things like contrast and brightness. Stupid Samsung ""Updated"" their photo editor and it SUCKS"
5,"April 22, 2018"," it's a handy little tool that actually works well on my sad little phone. i 
hope to see a few more tidbits added here and there for maximum use. great 
job!"
1,"June 18, 2018"," Complete ripoff of another app. The simplest thing like cropping doesn't 
even work. Terrible app you can do anything."
4,"June 13, 2018"," The only complaint I have about this app is when I put an existant ad in 
archives it will soon reappear on it's own as active for sale. Other than 
that it's great app."
5,"June 17, 2018"," I needed a good photo editor app. I saw the reviews and gave it a try. So 
far it has done very well for me . Glad it is so easy to use I hate 
complicated apps."
5,"July 7, 2018"," Needed an app to edit out a scab on my face and this has blemish and blur 
options. PERFECT!"
4,"July 9, 2018"," I've only edited one photo so far, can't see that you can change fonts for 
the text so that sucks... Not bad"
5,"May 15, 2018"," Thank you for making a rotten photograph look terrific. You have a fan for 
life! I like it so much, I've also installed it on my Samsung Galaxy 6S 
mobile phone."

Meme. It is the best photo app ever and u should DEFINITELY 100% try this 
app. I garantie that u will love it."

there isnt too many adds!! Awesome!! Thx for transforming my pix"
5,"May 28, 2018"," I just did my first picture n haven't had a chance to look at what the app 
did to the photo"
4,"April 15, 2018", It seems all right it's a decent replacement for the new filter app or whatever there is on the new Samsung cameras which really sucks cuz can't change the color or the 10th or the statue ation or anything else on them this one isn't as good as the one on my old phone but it's better than what's on ...Full ReviewIt seems all right it's a decent replacement for the new filter app or whatever there is on the new Samsung cameras which really sucks cuz can't change the color or the 10th or the statue ation or anything else on them this one isn't as good as the one on my old phone but it's better than what's on my new

3,"July 12, 2018"," I wish there were more options and not having to pay for it..but overall 
for a free app to edit pics. Its great"
5,"March 26, 2018"," This artistic app allows the artist to compliment the effects that Photoshop has, by providing some enhancements that Photoshop is not quite as strong on. The two apps work wonderfully together!"
5,"May 27, 2018"," I've been a hobby photo editor for a long time. This does most of what I 
can do on my PC on my phone. Fun"

quality of saved edited pictures. and memory usage ."
4,"July 4, 2018"," I really love this app there's some Futures which I wish I could manually 
put in and some features that they don't have anything to brighten your 
eyes but other than that it's great amazing HD"
3,"May 18, 2018"," Worked very well but should have a rate later button so you can do more 
than one edit before having to review"
5,"July 6, 2018"," At first did not know how to zoom in on a picture but when I got it (really 
easy , no clue how I missed it ) its helped me edit photos and give a 
professional look"

in correspondence with the vibes, but is aslo quick working smoth and clean 
looking üíØ Capital"
5,"February 13, 2018", I just got this app and it was very easy to use.  I do a lot of coloring in pencil and my camera does not capture the true image and seems a little off. This app brought my work back to life.

first place so STOP COPYING IT"

5,"May 26, 2018"," Perfect app for the photo lover, its very easy to use and it had an awesome 
assortment of tools and filters. I love it!!"
5,"March 29, 2018", I asked my son which photo editor was the best to have.  He recommended your app which he uses. He has had some very impressive photos that were edited by using this app!
5,"May 10, 2018"," Amazing so far . Just for little spots or marks, anything u feel 
uncomfortable about can be gone in a click. üòâ"
4,"February 26, 2018", I hv not had a chance to use the appointment  before being asked to give a rating!  But the other reviews we're so good that's why I choose to download it.
5,"June 12, 2018"," I love it bec.it has everything I need to do my corrections and touch ups 
on my own instead of just offering premade choices. I prefer to do my own 
touch ups most of the time so, ""Thank you."""
5,"May 22, 2018"," This app works really well. I am processing newspaper clippings and it 
restores and removes the aged yellow look and then puts them into high 
resolution for me."
3,"June 28, 2018"," I think this app is useful, but there's a lot of ads and you need to 
install the stickers which is really annoying! There should be more 
stickers."
5,"July 9, 2018"," The app creator asks very nicely for a rating. I'm impressed with the 
honesty and happy to recommend it. It's easy to use with cool options. Two

5,"April 8, 2018", Pretty good for side projects. Recommend for people without a laptop to edit or a camera for photography.
4,"April 4, 2018"," It's okay, just like all photo editor's. Needs better stickers. Needs filters"

looking for in a selfie cam, and more."
5,"April 3, 2018", Restored an old photo of my father when other apps failed.

4,"May 17, 2018", Same thing as Aviary photo editing

5,"January 10, 2018"," So far I LOVE it! Thank you, only thing I noticed when adding text to a photo I didn't find a way to edit the font? Not a huge deal, and there may be a download of some sort that I don't know about yet. Looking very forward to playing around with it some more! Once again thanks and great job!"
5,"November 3, 2017"," I swear I've been through a dozen of these photo editing apps today trying to find one that would do what I needed to do and without having to take a PhD in finding out how. This was the one! I'd happily pay o be rid of the ads though, and I wush it were a bit happier about working in landscape"
3,"August 29, 2017"," I have no idea what this app can do or what it's like! This is the first time I've launched it and it immediately asked me to rate it. Well, okay, here's your rating. I'll try to remember to come back and update the rating after I've had some time to experiment with the app."
4,"January 1, 2018", It was pretty darn good but few flaws like if how I might of done something and liking it at first then having second thoughts and not being able to remove and undo without having to discard the whole project that is the only issue. Overall I think that this app is worth installing.
4,"December 27, 2017", This is a really great photo editing app.Took me a second to figure it out but when I did I was surprised at all you could do to enhance the look of your photos.

Good going and thanks alot.It has become such a hassle. I have to delete it if IAM not using it because of storage and data issues. Then to have to resign in and then wait for email to be sent etc. When all I wanna do is fix photo makes it a hassle for me. I am sure it is only a problem for me. But other then that it's a terrific app.
5,"October 29, 2017", I had this app on a past phone and the UI is awesome. The sharpen and focus features are the best. Thank you for creating an editing app that does the job without causing the frustration  other editing apps can cause.
3,"November 26, 2017"," Ads are a problem, I can understand you need some ads to make it free but what I don't like is those full screen ads, when I'm doing something it suddenly goes to a full screen ad and it difficult to get back, for that reason I'm uninstalling."
5,"December 9, 2017"," This is so amazing! Easy to use and navigate. My pictures look great because of this app. I just bought the Samsung Galaxy 8 phone, the camera it has is Awesome but this app improves the look and quality of my photos! Great job! I love this app!"
3,"September 1, 2017"," Well the app wanted me to rate before i was able to try,so here is my rating. Maybe will change later when i was able to try it in depth"
4,"September 30, 2017", So far so good. Don't like that I'll edit and then go to the home page of the app and it's the original photo I have to click another tool to see the edits I just did again...
5,"September 24, 2017", Does all the basics. I think you have to buy the fancy stuff. Gives a few freebies but not useful. Good APP for basic editing.
5,"December 5, 2017", I need a photo editing app for my new phone. And this one seems to to enhance my photos the way I want. Also I like I can purchase no ads on it. I hope it works out with this app.
5,"November 2, 2017", Love the variety and professional aspects! There is a great amount of different ways to personalize each option (for lack of a better word)
5,"October 2, 2017"," It is the first time I'm using this app. So far it's okay. It's is pretty easy to use, it is better than the one I used before. Thank you."
4,"October 13, 2017", Only used it once but it's very similar to Photo Editor which they both could be better as far as Enhancement Got & Stickers !!

2,"July 17, 2017", Me pay for less than starter drawing app ?? Nope WhatI have to do to get a simple photo paint that has copy and paste? I mean those are normal tools for that kind of app . this is frustrating there are apps claiming to be pro apps only offing photo frames and text editing .
1,"May 2, 2017", Not bad but trying to find where it actually saves your photo is like the search for the holy grail. Still haven't found it (5hrs later). Not everyone wants to 'share' their pic immediately !.
4,"April 24, 2017", All i wanted to do was reverse/flip/mirror my image and it seemed everytime i did a search i found the wrong thing. This is perfect now to discover the many other capabilities.
4,"May 13, 2017"," Used it for the first time & liked it. It came very close to giving me the end result i was looking for, which is to lighten a very dark picture i took while on vacation"
4,"June 17, 2017", Just downloaded and so far I like the editing features this app has to offer.  I would like to see more to Accessorize each picture. It's an Easy to use app. Must say Great job to the developer. Highly recommend!
4,"April 28, 2017"," Really like, would like to adjust eye color. In one pic my daughter's beautiful blue eyes look dark grey. It would be perfect if I could adjust that."
5,"June 9, 2017"," Best photo editor on play store..period..easy, simple small in size. Not to mention amazing effects, frames etc"
5,"May 28, 2017"," Pretty amazed at how awesome this app is! Only tweak I'd like is to be able to have the overlay without having to crop my picture, but other than that this app is fantastic"
4,"June 10, 2017"," Splendid array of features.  I found the blemish removal tool removing too much of the picture, but perhaps I will get better at it.  Thank you very much for the app."
4,"May 9, 2017"," Easy interface, plenty of options for casual editors and for serious jazz, you can pay to get some real deal professional tools."
5,"April 28, 2017", I think this is my favorite editing app it helped me because my friend gave me bunny ears and I drew even better on es on him
1,"May 18, 2017", Starts itself every other hour in the background wasting battery and RAM. Unacceptable (but can be auto-killed using a good task manager).
5,"June 19, 2017", I really like this app celaya was well thought-out and intuitive and had lots of photo modification choices. Good job Developers!
4,"May 11, 2017"," Only used once, but liked what I had time to see...will play with it more when time permits."
5,"June 1, 2017", Great app!!! Just what I was looking for. It has all the effects and filter and let you change brightness and sharpness and all other stuff!
5,"April 28, 2017", I love the one click editing as well as the ability to fine tune the adjustments. Splash feature is great for highlighting what is important in a picture.
3,"May 31, 2017", Like it wish I did not have to download a tone of stuff just to use but there nice easy to use
5,"June 10, 2017", LOVE THE EASY PHOTO EDIT AS I HAVE EPILEPSY & APPRECIATE SIMPLICITY- THANKS
5,"May 20, 2017", Photo Editor Pro has made the images acquired by my smart phone camera absolutely mind boggling rather than dull and boring!
4,"May 26, 2017", Didn't take but five minutes to figure this photo app out. Great one for easy work
5,"April 29, 2017", I love photography and this app makes things so much easier. It also make my pictures much better.
5,"May 22, 2017", It has so many things that other apps do not have!!And trust me I have tried everything!!!üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
5,"June 3, 2017", I use different editing apps but this is the one I use first to perfect my pics best.  Truly my favorite!
4,"April 21, 2017", Best photo editor I have ever used good job
5,"July 5, 2017", Easy to use. I would like more direct editing rather than pre-designed filters. I would also like a collage  feature. The app is intuitive snd easy to use. Im enjoying it.
5,"June 18, 2017", Been working with this one. I love it. Im able to get great pics and edit them just the way i like.

5,"July 28, 2017", I think its brilliant  specially when I want two photo beside each other in a frame or on my home page
