I'm looking for a arrow pointing feature that's more professional than drawing on free hand. Oh well, still on the search."
1,"April 30, 2018"," It seems that they removed a free feature that allowed me to paste photos

2,"January 20, 2018"," Exactly what i needed, besides i wish there were a way to zoom farther and an option for finer lines when drawing. I rated low because after editing, 85% of time app closes as soon as you try to save work. So only saves approx. 15% of time. Frustrating!"

The features and tools are good. I like the meme creator in particular.  The app isn't without it's shortfalls though.  The tutorial popped up multiple times in the middle of a project, and erased the edits I was working on. This is a poor design.  The ads are super frequent and very annoying. I understand the need for ads to keep the app free, but it was irritating to the point I rarely use this app anymore."

ads."
2,"June 8, 2018"," Cropping changes the colours on my photos! The recent update ruins any sort 
of editing. I need to find another editor now. Such a shame."
3,"April 19, 2018"," I do not at all recommend this app. It loads a different picture than you 
clicked on, and the blemish does not do a whole lot. I would like to try 
the older version, because people obviously liked that better, but now, 
it's kinda garbage."
4,"July 15, 2018"," The pictures aren't the truth, they glamorouize it to much with the pretty

This is great, love it by the way~üíû"

drawing function is frustrating to use, so I'm not very fond of it."
1,"February 28, 2018", I HATE the new photo editor. It was PERFECT before they changed everything. Especially the blur tool! Bring the old one back!
4,"February 4, 2018", I really like this app. I use to have another photo editing app but you couldn't add any text so I went to the play store and found this photo editing app and I absolutely love it.
3,"February 7, 2018"," Really enjoyed this app until update. Blemish feature is just a spot corrector now, used to be able to swipe entire area, And blended nicely. Filters still the same,  Been using this app for 2 years, guess it's time to search for a new one"
2,"April 22, 2018"," I understand the need to have ads to support an app that's free, but there 
are way too many, easily the most ads of any app I have ever used. It 
almost kills the functionality of the app"
5,"May 17, 2018"," I managed to get my nan to download this and I keep editing photos from her

3,"March 15, 2018"," This app does exactly what I want.  It's very useful, but the ads are ridiculous.  Is there a ""pro"" version without ads?"
3,"July 16, 2018"," The app is actually great but can be done better. There should be a manual 
setting for the size of text and its inclination, there can also be an 
option for adding shapes. Also remove the involvement of adobe in your 
application. Overall the app is good for making collages and casual pics."
3,"February 7, 2018"," Although it has adds it does what it's supposed to do.  The only thing is, sometimes I would have to keep redoing an edit because I would mess up and hit the picture wrong and it was just fall apart and I would have to start over again...but it was prob because I had no idea what I was doing."
3,"March 24, 2018"," It's already doing the basics... However, You'd better think :  copy and paste a part of the picture.  Make it easy to write down notes on the picture using my tablet pen. Text editor should support more languages..... Etc"
1,"February 27, 2018", The app shows that you can edit the photo with frames and stickers....but each thing you want is another download instead of being included or something to sigh up for. Waste of my time.

In the app it would not bother me as I know devs. Need money like the rest of us do, but home screen? Thats some stuff that my grandma asking me to get off her phone. If you enjoy your lock screen photo, and want a free app. I advise you to look elsewhere."
3,"November 22, 2017"," Stickers won't work for me, everytime I go to 'sign up' to download them it will tell me there's a problem and I can't get in. Also the whitening tool is grainy and there is only one font for text. It's a good program basis but it really needs some work."
1,"December 6, 2017", Horrible! Kaiser Permanente Ads pop up & play & CANNOT be removed even after viewing. In the midst of using the app everything comes to a halt & your work is lost. Tried several times. Absolutely not worth the stress just so the developers can make a little extra $$.
3,"December 13, 2017"," I had it for just ten minutes and it had crashed twice... I still have it though,  and it's doing OK,  so I hope it doesn't crash again...üòä"
5,"November 26, 2017", Honestly i can not express my love for this app its so fun and easy to use I recommend for any ff YouTubers.
5,"December 7, 2017"," Nice app, really But the frequently popping (adds.) seem annoying"
4,"November 15, 2017", I can't find stylish text. I think this app will be more better to add this option
4,"December 5, 2017", It's very good the thing I don't like is you have to download things but it's a very good app I like the frames it's awesome
2,"November 17, 2017", Pathetic... Picture becomes so small how the hell u will edit it when its so small
1,"December 18, 2017", HORRIBLE I was saving my work and was going to exit out I had finished and then it said photo editor has stopped working a lot of times in through with this app!
5,"November 7, 2017", THIS APP IS SO AMAZING TYSM FOR MAKING IT IT IS THE BEST APP EVER FOR EDITING TYSM
5,"December 17, 2017", I loved this app it worked wonders on all my photos and there are not too many adds as well as many filters and alot of free choices
1,"December 15, 2017", Do yourself a favor and don't download.  Way to many ads. Every photo I edit shows 2 ads then you can edit another photo then come more ads
1,"December 23, 2017", No editors r provide properly and ads  and not gud app
2,"December 25, 2017"," It's useful for basic editing, but the ads are very intrusive. A full-screen ad with every save."
4,"November 1, 2017"," This app has really helped me a lot for my pic's editing just if, it's blemish feature would become a little more sharp I would have totally loved it."
5,"November 7, 2017", Very cool app but I can't restore some plugin and cannot log in to my creative cloud
4,"November 15, 2017", I have no idea what this app does
5,"November 17, 2017", Brings a wow effect to your photos sharp new view spawns creativity ...
5,"November 20, 2017"," I'm love it's, photo can write what I'm feeling it, much appreciated"
1,"November 22, 2017", It keeps crashing every 5 mins
5,"November 16, 2017", It's good for me but only frame is not quite fashionable
5,"November 19, 2017"," Best applications, very useful. Recommended for 5 star."
1,"December 12, 2017", Worst app. Please don't install
1,"December 20, 2017", Uninstalled after 10sec...from the 1st second I launch the app I get Ads...seriously..I did'nt even touch it yet...

1,"September 6, 2017", Adds its own lock screen for no reason. Uninstalling.  What an irrelevant and pointless idea. Devs are absolute cretins for letting that happen.  Some forethought would have been worthwhile you utter imbeciles.
3,"September 22, 2017", The app seemed to degrade image quality and made my pics really grainy. There are no settings that allow you to change resolution or size. Otherwise it's easy to use.
1,"September 1, 2017"," Do not bother with this app. It doesn't work. Please, for the love of cats, dogs not waste your time. Source another app that isn't riddled with ads that'll take over your phone, and an editor that does what it says."
5,"September 29, 2017"," Such an easy app to use and navigate, which makes editing a lot more fun. You can get really creative too. All in all, I'm fairly impressed."
5,"August 29, 2017"," üëçpretty good for basic editing, but I can't stand the advertisements.  I definitely use it for my own editing quite a bit but not something I would pay to use."
3,"September 3, 2017"," Started off great but limited compared to other free to use apps. Only 5 pics, no video, or Slideshow ability. Works great for Instagram photos tho"
1,"October 16, 2017", It is one thing to have adds inside the app. It's a totally different situation when adds pop up on your phone outside the app. Uninstall trash delete.
1,"September 24, 2017", You should remove the ads. Everytime an ad pops up and i close the ad my tablet crashes. If you dont remove them i will unistall this app.
1,"October 2, 2017", This app actually interrupts my phones operating system to run ads. Avoid if you don't like that.
1,"September 26, 2017"," It shows a huge add on your lock screen. How ridiculous, plus it made my alarm fail."
2,"October 18, 2017", This was good at first but I think it's a virus because it keeps kicking me off my apps and opens this app instead so I uninstalled it.
1,"October 13, 2017", Ad Ware that hijacks your lock screen. Do not install this garbage
1,"October 13, 2017", Annoying. I was thinking that those giving 1 star were wrong. Trust me. Complete disaster. Not good even for stickers
2,"September 12, 2017"," Too many ads, when I turned on my tablet the app instantly put on an ad for me before I even unlocked my device"
5,"September 12, 2017", photo*[100% quality ] (editing)=&gt; beautiful photo +(97% ++) quality thats amazing compairing to the others photo editor apps
5,"October 17, 2017", I use several editing apps to apply different filters and effects on my photos and this app is definitely one of my must have photo editing apps.
1,"September 8, 2017", Wants to install unrelated junk? Something about charging info... Instant uninstall.
2,"September 2, 2017", Not good. Constant stream if full page intrusive ads. There is no undo function. Moving and resizing texts and other overlays is clumsy and frustrating.  The overlays are never in the exact spot you place them for the final image.
1,"August 25, 2017"," The ""text"" feature does not work at all!"
1,"September 17, 2017"," It's the legit same thing as ""Photo Editor Pro"" by Zentertain. Be original, I mean come on. That app wasn't great to begin with."
1,"October 18, 2017", This is trash don't download it I downloaded and i baked my r account
1,"August 22, 2017", It crashed my phone and I had to delete it
3,"September 20, 2017", Still new to the app. After more use I'll reevaluate. Don't like that you can't individually save changes per feature.
5,"October 13, 2017", I think that it is very helpful when you want to edit a picture and whem you do it will ask you if you want to share the picture to anyone elseüòçüòÑ
5,"October 4, 2017", I don't know y people say that there's ads when there isn't. It a pretty dang cool photo editor I love it
1,"September 5, 2017", Too many adds and no productivity - #uninstalled
1,"August 22, 2017", Just did an update for this app and had a warning from my antivirus (AVG) that adware is present in the app.
1,"December 20, 2017", All the add-ons require an Adobe login. Apparently.vrashes when you try to link the two. Ads are obnoxious.
1,"September 18, 2017", The Ads ... Is there not a paid version without Ads? Lasted 5 mins before uninstalling.
3,"August 23, 2017", Nice but have ads. I don't like so many ads
1,"October 24, 2017", This is a copy cat app. The only difference is that this app has more adds
5,"September 7, 2017"," Very very good app,you can download it.it is very useful."
5,"October 3, 2017", its easy to use and has all necessary functions I need. üòä
1,"September 4, 2017", This app put a screen over my lock screen so I'd have to swipe 2xs to get into my phone -.-
2,"October 6, 2017", I think they can get a point for effort
5,"September 2, 2017", I love it u can design your own photo from your gallery
1,"February 26, 2018", IT WAS THE ANDROID.UMENG MALWARE DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!
2,"September 13, 2017", Can't zoom before drawing. Intrusive ads. Uninstalled.
5,"September 4, 2017", Quick and very easy to use.
5,"September 8, 2017", Leave others it really works I swear
