app can. 1 star!"
1,"July 12, 2018", Fake its fake it doesn't work when i want to cut it
3,"July 9, 2018"," While the app is good enough, cropping images changes the size of the

1,"March 22, 2018", Instructions would be very helpful. Otherwise be prepared to waste tons of time going in circles and getting frustrated.   Uninstalling
1,"July 4, 2018"," This is horrible. Cutting the photo is unforgiving and there are several 
better options available with other free apps."
1,"July 4, 2018"," Very very bad u will kill the creators of this app, if they come in front 
of me"
1,"March 9, 2018", Lame app.. Pop up ads constantly. Re sizes photos automatically making your edits useless.
1,"February 6, 2018", All I want to do is cut out a damn circle and save it. This this app will only save it if you cut It out and paste it onto something else. Very limited.

1,"April 16, 2018"," The picture that you crop is faded, and unrealistic."
