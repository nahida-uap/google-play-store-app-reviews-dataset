this. Please don't add a user community, or if you must, make a separate

2,"March 10, 2018"," This app makes it easy to edit photos on your phone. There are a bunch of features and, when they work, it's great. However, after I save my photo, if I'm using the ""blur"" or ""smooth"" photo edit, it saves little black dots all over where I edited thus negating my editing. Very annoying."

Amazing high standard and user friendly app. Few glitches and the stickers now show up in my phone gallery. Also crashes a lot when using frames and when you use the auto fix with multiple frames and filters. The text shadows move even after you set it. But still my favourite app!! I spent hours and hours editing pics and have paid 4 times as my google accounts were hacked so I say this so that you developers know how much o love this app. Also good work on the user friendly GUI just one request change the pro app to not have to download everything make it immediately available. the other great thing the free version doesn't add a logo on images though the ads are annoying but it doesnt bother much just remove the pro choices from the freeware and add an ad at the beginning or on save at the end. As for the pro version splash screen ads after i paid for the app and it is annoying when an ad pops up while editing. Please no. Just no. I've paid for this app 4 times i hate ads pleaseeee thanks still 5 stars!!

5,"November 3, 2017", I use this all the time for my online adverts for my beauty business. All in one place you can add text with lots of fonts to choose from. Put on a filter and add pip effects. I was so impressed I bought the full version.

1,"November 17, 2017"," I bought  it because it was cool, but what is the point of pro if I can't download in the shop.  So I i uninstalled and installed after a while and I still can't download no filters üòê"
5,"November 13, 2017"," My favorite of the photo retouching apps. I can't exactly carry the entire Adobe suite around on my phone, but with this I don't wish I could."
4,"November 12, 2017"," This is top 3 for me. I love the text feature. It's got great features but it's text on photo is extreme. Lots of fonts, styles, and effects."
2,"November 11, 2017", New update removed a very practical feature. Can no longer put pictures on top or behind them in the collage feature. There used to be a button for that and it's no longer there....
4,"November 23, 2017"," I'm still learning how to use properly, even with directions on how to use features myself personally will need more time to figure out what exactly this app can do. It looks great, however before I can give you my honest opinion."
1,"November 7, 2017", It isn't working at all since about 3 weeks ago. I'm so disappointed considering I paid for it.

Suddenly the app does not remember my font, even when I do one pic after the other.  And suddenly it's impossible to re- write the original pic, it simply does not store it.  I really liked the former outlet of the app but the new arrangement etc are just killing my nerves.  And I don't like that I can't delete the fonts coming with the  app originally.   The last (or last 2) update (s) were into the wrong direction."

4,"October 12, 2017"," They moved the AutoCorrect feature in the latest version, which threw me because I couldn't locate it. Ugh. Devs love to do this sort of thing which is frustrating. At least it's still a feature, which makes me happy."
5,"October 8, 2017", This program ranks up there with the best. The big thing for me besides all the customizability is that there is a version for my laptop too so i can work with it either way.
5,"October 7, 2017"," This is the best photograph app I have used TO DATE. It was hard for me to find one that I could use because I don't know much about the terms or photography. Needless to say, I can use this one, and use it well. üòâ"
1,"October 6, 2017", App is trash.  It's so buggy.  Anytime you make an edit on a photo...it will flip it 90 degrees...but when you edit the photo...it is normal.  so dont over write any pictures because they will be worthless...it completely changes the file and makes it trash
5,"October 5, 2017", Everything were fine but i really hate your f*****g ads... White the pro version you have to remover those things.
2,"October 6, 2017", I'd give it 4 stars if not for ads that interfere in usability. I use it to create cognitive & sensory photos for my health. Your additions are now accessibility challenges!
5,"October 28, 2017", Best app out there!!!!! No issues or freeze up. Gives you editing freedom like you can only imagine the possibilities!
4,"October 6, 2017", It's pissing me off. Won't show the colors I've chosen for the ink until I've complete the pic and there's no going back. Either I have to start from scratch or just hope the colors work in the end.
5,"October 26, 2017"," Best app I've used for editing next to photo shop.  So much easier and cheaper to use than photo shop.  And the free version is awesome too! Don't find that to often,  been using it almost 2years.  I'm pretty fkn happy with this app."
5,"November 1, 2017"," Awesome picture app! I will definitely recommend this to family and friends! The frames are sweet and the effects are amazing, anyone looking for an app for pictures stop here and download! You will love it!"
4,"October 21, 2017"," i'm like, but don't exist + the auto fix photo options, is good funtion"
4,"October 24, 2017", I've given 4 Stars because I tried using the clone tool and no matter what I do it isn't applying over the area I move the cloned area to. Apart from that everything else works brilliantly.
5,"October 10, 2017", Completely worth the purchase! Love it!!  10/10/17 : Minor glitches after last update were completely fixed! The app is perfect again!! üòÑ
5,"October 13, 2017", Wonderful tool for photos!  Love playing with this app with my photos.   So many things you can do!

3,"September 16, 2017", I love PRO I've had it for 2 years now. However with the recent update it keeps saying i have to buy PRO which I already have....
4,"September 14, 2017", Great App. Most features don't look that impressive on a desktop pc but on a mobile device they do look good. A really functional app and a must for your device. Also receives decent regular updates.
3,"September 16, 2017", I'm having the same issue the other reviewer has it keeps telling me to purchase pro which I already have.
1,"September 15, 2017", Horrible app...pay for that but still not let me do the editing

5,"September 13, 2017", Totally awesome! Some of the thing I've created that I didn't know I could. It's got me wishing I had pursued an education in computer graphics.
5,"September 12, 2017", I appreciate your hard work and in new update you have added feature to edit manually by hands but we still can't manually remove effects or filters from desired places in a photo like that in Picsart.
3,"September 9, 2017"," Please fix the new update messed up the app lighting,  shadows and contrast are now messed up"
5,"September 14, 2017", I use this for everything... From creating photo id's for work to creating the signage for my wedding reception. It's my go to app. I even have it dl'd to my work laptop for easy access. Worth the money.

It also has a lot of features that I personally do not need nor use, like the multitude of effects and filters. For powerful photo editing, there are better apps out there like Fotor.  But this is still a very good app.  UPDATE July 6: It has a bug, at least on my phone (LG G4, Android 6.0), whereby I cannot save to the microSD card. I contacted support and moved the app to my microSD  card but same issue. Rather odd but looks like there is no solution to it."
5,"July 31, 2017", BRILLIANT APP! Didn't feel like I needed the pro version but because I was impressed by the free version decided to support the dev team. Great work guys. Do you guys have a tutorial channel on YouTube?
5,"July 5, 2017"," Found this by accident. So glad I did. I use the text section to watermark my photos before putting anything online. Everything is easy to use, with so many features to choose from."
1,"August 13, 2017"," I used to love this app, then it updated, and using the pip effects none of the backgrounds save they all revert to original picture. Wish I could get my money back. Don't waste your time with this application."

5,"August 5, 2017", Updated from July 2016 ::  I still have this app and love the new improvements. My collages and pic frames are wonderful for household posters!! Totally worth the couple bucks.

5,"June 24, 2017"," My favorite part of this app is the ability to lighten your photos, because many times photos come out too dark.  That, along with all of the other filters and additions available, makes this one of my favorite all-time apps!!"
5,"September 6, 2017"," Absolutely amazing. I use this app to fix light on my photos and to add a little splash on them. This app is so great. So many features, options, and customization tools. It's endless. If you're using reviews to make your decision.. then use mine and go for it! You won't regret it."
5,"October 2, 2017", Dear developer you have created this app on andriod and ios mobile but please bring for ipad version too is gonna be really great bcz lot of people are using ipad pro they are leaving laptop  and your program will be on great positions did you know that ???

5,"September 1, 2017"," This is the best app that so far I have ever used. I've tried 5 or 6 other similar apps, no other app even comes close to this one. They kept adding new and even cooler add on's.....keep it up!!!!"
3,"June 20, 2017", It won't let me download any of the new add-ons. I've even reset my Wi-Fi on my phone and my router with no success.
1,"July 20, 2017", Google said to reinstall and then it made me pay 4.99 again. Scam
4,"July 7, 2017", Still need more stickers and frames also glass effect should have a option glass should drag where we want to
2,"October 17, 2017", The worst paid photo editing app. The app isn't optimised and the effects are tacky.
4,"July 26, 2017", I want to highlight some texts on my screen capture (e.g.from a sports article) by drawing a red line box around these block of texts. Can I do this with this app?

4,"July 4, 2017", Photo Editor is great. Easy to use. Good variety. Wish it had object removal. But why ruin a good thing.
5,"September 13, 2017", Add some more like bokeh effect or portrait mode
3,"August 12, 2017", In pic frame function Zoom in and Zoom out feature is required as seen in  Sony album in Xperia mobile

I didn't really know how great and powerful this is until I couldn't use it anymore, and tried others not finding what I needed.  See I started using this app because it was embedded in Verizon's message+ stock messaging. Photo studio was the only reason I was using vz message plus, it allowed seemles editing and it only took a few clicks to get from inside the messaging app to the photo studio editor and back to the messaging app. One day photo studio was no longer part of Verizon's message+. So I started my quest. I ended up dumping vzmessage+. Back to this app... One great feature in this app is the grid while editing as well as the ability to zoom while adding marks on the picture, or being able to scroll using 2 finger swipe. These seem so basic but I found no other app that did it like photo studio. Other apps do it but it takes more clicks to get around.  The biggest plus is that I now go from my preferred messaging app to photo studio and back to attaching the picture in almost the same amount of clicks as when it was embedded in vz message+. Actually a few more, but this is ok. If you used message plus and you miss photo studio like I did until now. Get photo studio pro well worth the 5 bucks , then  pair it up with Android messages and you will be very happy!!!.  To flow from on to the other include the messaging app album from within photo studio, then you will have direct access to pictures saved to this folder, u will be able to edit and share with a few clicks. !!!  Hope this was helpful;-)!"
