not wanting to be overwhelmed by more intensive platforms. One drawback

Objectively, it is a good platform for basic and quick editing."

You'd never think that one small malfeasance could ruin an entire experience, but after 15 minutes trying to align text to a border without having a snap or auto-alignment feature I was absolutely disgusted. I'd give it negative stars if I could."
3,"April 2, 2018", It's an OK app which could be made better with a selection of fonts. Standard print is  not sufficient.
1,"April 6, 2018"," This app straight sucks. Extremely counterintuitive to use, and every time I try to make any kind of adjustment it zooms the photo way out to the size of a thumbnail and won't let you zoom in. How fantastically helpful that is."
1,"May 24, 2018"," App kept telling me to restart when I'd save and I'd lose all progress 
Double sad face! :,( :,("
1,"June 13, 2018"," This app causes pop up ads long after you've exited the platform. It took a 
lot of trial and error to discover it came from here. So many and so 
distracting, I thought it was malware and I had a virus."
5,"June 14, 2018"," I really hate all ads in this editing app - it's VERY ANNOYING! They don't 
explain how to get rid of them either! To me, ""Pro"" means no freaking ads! 
Don't fall for it!"
4,"May 31, 2018"," App will not even load on my samsung galaxy running android 4.2.2. 
Seriously!? Now the worst app I have tried and when it does load it opens 
other apps that I didn't even open and also the add at start up is the

5,"May 2, 2018"," I was a little worried at first (because I have seen a lot of these type of 
apps that don't actually work), but I was very happy with how it came out. 
I will always use this to edit my photos!"
1,"December 27, 2017"," Could not do anything with this app. It kept telling me I had to sign up to dowbload packs of editing supplies, but then had an error everytime I tried to sign up. Frustrating!!"
1,"January 1, 2018"," Despite calling its self an editor it doesn't actually have any tools to edit a photo, not even a crop tool. Just adding effects and stamps ect. More of a bedazzler."
5,"January 23, 2018", Love it. Always have. I recommend to all my friends However I always get authentication error when wanting to use more effects
4,"June 9, 2018"," Love this app, wish it had some beauty features also, to fix A few things, 
like smooth out or tired eyes from.working all night. Other than that, Love 
it!"
2,"March 7, 2018"," Can't open this app from my photos, can't view all photos, it expects me to go through them all one by one, to find the one I want to edit, that will take ages! Stupid system."
4,"January 20, 2018", i like the basics of this app. its clean fun and effective at cropping adding exposure or uping contrast and be it overlays filters or masks...its the way to go for photo editing
3,"July 12, 2018", Simple and easy to use. Downfall is I can't save the app to my SD card.
3,"April 26, 2018"," Have to sign up for each individual effect...its stupid.why have a photo 
editor app that you cant edot photos witjkit sihning up fpr a separate app."
4,"February 26, 2018", Only problem I'm having is that I can't restore all my filters and accessories cents I've redownload the app :( but other then that I absolutely love this app
4,"March 20, 2018"," Only 4 stars because it won't let me link my adobe to get the free frames and free filters. Otherwise it's great! I love it. Very simple, awesome UI. Great for beginners and advanced alike"
5,"May 25, 2018"," I really do like this app it is fairly easy to use has some pretty nice 
effects would like more stickers....not sure there probably are more I just 
haven't had the time to look through it"

2,"January 7, 2018", Have had this app for 3 yrs..cant access the Adobe acct..it won't let me sign in and I've reached out to tech support
2,"January 29, 2018", Wouldn't let me do any emojis on text after it showed the emojis but when I saved it it just got rid of the emojis. Didn't completely work üñìüñìüñì
5,"February 28, 2018", Really good awesome it's a good app I think there should be a little bit improvements like you can cover up like little parts of your skin or whatever you want in the photo to use it
2,"March 18, 2018", I can only use the original effects and cant download more. I can't even sign in. There is also no editing feature for face.
3,"December 30, 2017", Would be a 5-star if not for avalanche of ads. Would pay a few bucks for ad-free version. Toooooo many ads to navigate actual app. Uninstalling until ads go or paid app without ads.
2,"June 29, 2018"," I can't sign in. It's very aggravating bc I want to use more of the 
stickers. Other than that I like it Please fix it"
5,"May 7, 2018"," I love this app!! It is so fun and makes my photos amazing! I used to use 
INSTAGRAM to edit my photos but i found this app."
5,"May 1, 2018"," I've used this app for a couple years now..I haven't found one yet that 
provides as many features as photo editor pro."
3,"May 7, 2018"," Cannot find photos to edit only recent photos are there, the rest are in a 
random order no option to use a file explorer."
1,"May 22, 2018"," If you want to spend forever scrolling for the picture you want to ediy, 
then sure maybe this appnis for you, but not me. To time consuming."
3,"April 4, 2018", Have to restart your whole edit to go back instead of an undo button.  Not a lot of frames that would work aviary wouldn't work

5,"April 24, 2018"," love it's featured in enhancing photo's, just don't like having to give 
permission to my personal stuff on my phone, seems like other applications, 
violating, but does have cool manipulation"
1,"April 30, 2018"," Cuts out most of the pic when editing. You have to pre edit before even 
uploading on the app making it useless"
1,"April 12, 2018"," This is a good app for editing, but when you are done it doesn't save! I 
would not recommend this app or get it again if my life depended on it. You 
shouldn't get it either."
4,"January 9, 2018", I wish in the text you could go back and fix a typo instead of having to delete everything until you get to it
1,"April 2, 2018"," Worst photo editor app EVER!!!! Super hard to use, not much for special features or customization. One million thumbs down"
4,"March 5, 2018", I have tried many photo editing apps and this continues to be the absolute best and its free.
5,"January 10, 2018"," I love this!  I've tired other photo apps before but this one is fun, easy to use and has lots of choices."
4,"February 10, 2018", It's pretty cool... lots of options. Can't stop messing with it.
1,"May 25, 2018"," It LIES it has no good stickers only crapy ones and no emoticons at all. 
Worst app ever!"
3,"March 26, 2018", There is no essential effects from this app  Like sorry to say I didn't like it its just an okay app
1,"April 1, 2018", The included edits are very limited. To get anything else you need to create an Adobe account. No thanks.
1,"December 26, 2017", No More Borders... Won't let me sign in OR sign up for Adobe to add other borders. Tells me it can't authentucate.

photos look natural. Great for beginners."
1,"January 20, 2018", This app stinks would not let me choose the drive to save to a waste of time an effort
2,"April 12, 2018", It's okay but it keeps crashing when I try to save my work so I have to restart.
5,"May 31, 2018"," It helps me shade my minecraft skins because I can not shade that good in

Tried clear cache, clear data, uninstalled even, restarted phone thinking might be something from the OS, even though it should not be related. Was very dissatisfied with that and wished to forget about this up forever. Seems went back to normal now. For me it would have been a 5 star app if not for Adobe sign in. I don't appreciate ads either, but so many apps with them at this point i can't remember one without them. So even with the ads I'd still rate it as 5 star. But i used this app for some time and before i didn't have to sign in to anything at all. giving that the app comes with no package by default which it should, and the user have to go to the trouble of downloading all the content at least it should not have any more barriers. This kind of thing makes an app lose users and get bad ratings. And i really thing this app deserves full attention. Other cons would be that you can't undo in any editing state which makes it at times hard to handle, and other one is that you can't zoom images in some editing states, and it's a pretty essential need when it comes to editing more details. Fix these things mentioned and it will be a hell of an app desired by everyone!"
3,"June 7, 2018"," I think the being able to color off things that come on some of the 
screenshots is cool but I would rather be able to actually be able to erase 
it or cut the other parts you don't want off."
