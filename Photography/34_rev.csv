The resolution and size changes somewhat, in that an image sized 1112-1288 could end up being sized 479-555. That doesn't inconvenience me too much, but it does bother me to a degree. I can deal with it for now though. 2. There aren't enough fonts, it has up to 28(?) fonts and I only ended up using 2-5 of them. I would really, really like it if it had a larger variety of fonts was added, would help things be more diverse.  It's good, I like it.

It is very handy, and goes well to be compared to Adobe and PowerPoint. In fact, I find myself seeing this more useful than both.   My Suggestion: Since I save some picture samples, or ""schemes"" to use later on, I feel like the developers should allow an option for users to save unique ""schemes"" or samples to use. For example, I make a series of biographies of people from the past, and I use this app to make a front cover for the post. And the front cover usually has a frame to have the picture in and a border on the right where it has a title and other information. So what I do is I make a unique image for a formula or ""scheme"" to use for that series. I suggest the developers to have some kind of option in the menu where users can save samples to continue a project, series, or some kind of particular work. Very useful!"

I use this app to draw and up to now I really loved it. I like some new features but I have a major issue with two parts. First, I really dislike how even though I have it for it to be not 'smooth' I still have transparent squares on my line edges. Also the same transparent squares on edges when I erase an area or when I copy the layer. This makes my colors uneven when layering (which is why I like the option to not smooth). Second, when I want to pick a color on the draw option with the picture/photo tab it is no longer zoomed in or gives you an option to zoom in which makes it nearly impossible to get the color you want. If you like drawing digitally I don't recommend this app (anymore). If you like editing your pictures like cropping and effects while keeping the quality of your photo then I do recommend this app."
