...Full ReviewBest editing app ever! I love this, very impressed! It's the best editing 
app I have found/used, and goes over my expectations, very good. Almost 
everything is good, but for the cutting - it's okay that it fills in other 
spaces that was not meant to be filled when you tap for the red to show up 
just because you can draw the red, but the drawing has this problem too. 
When you DO draw with the red on the object/person, it fills in spaces 
around the object or person which is kinda annoying. It would aslo be good 
to have an eraser in cutting. Please take my advice on this and update the 
app fixing/adding these things. Other than the two problems in cutting, 
great work. (By the way, these two problems are the only reason I have a 4 
star rating, you have an extra star waiting to be added!)"
3,"July 18, 2018"," One of my top editing apps. The only complaint I have is that sometimes the 
removal tool just cuts and pastes another area of the photo into the area I 
want to remove. At other times, it completely removes the area I've painted 
over. Great little app! :)"
1,"July 14, 2018"," Too much of our private information is needed to use this application. 
Sadly, I don't need to editor a single picture that bad for you to access 
my social media, Web browsers, purchases/payments and my date of birth. 
Google Play should remove CyberLink apps from store."
5,"July 15, 2018"," The app is one of my main editing apps. It works very well and has many 
features that i love to play around with. The only problem is that there 
are acational ads, and even then they are very rare!"
4,"July 7, 2018"," So far, it's good. I haven't tried everything yet, but for the few simple 
things I've done, it's been great. It would just be better if once you 
'finished' adding text, you could go back on it to edit it. Otherwise, 
fantastic!"
5,"July 12, 2018"," This app is the best that I used.If u can use there very much 
functions,that u always need. If somebody says its bad app coz he or she 
has mistakes with working. Thank you so much. I found any mistake from this 
app. üòòGood luck, Iroda!"
5,"July 9, 2018"," Old version is better than this new update coz.wgen i edit text when i save 
from old version is no problem but in this update its changing to blur..its 
really upset. So please solve this problem"
5,"July 9, 2018"," Really enjoying editing with this app. Great fun and awesome effects. A bit 
limited on options of fonts, effects if you have free version, not sure 
what full version offers."
1,"July 16, 2018"," Bait and Switch ::: July of 2018 ::: Great tools that can be used once, or 
once a day without upgrading to an annual subscription. Don't waste your 
time."
5,"July 9, 2018"," One of the best photo editing apps in the app stores. It makes it easy to 
have your own photo as you like in just seconds. I use it directly snap 
photo and edit it to promote my products. It is amazing"
5,"July 13, 2018"," I have been using this app for a long time.... The only drawback i've ever 
come across is the effects need to be paid to be used"
5,"July 8, 2018"," I've never reviewed an app but I was so impressed with this one that I 
wanted to let people know how great it is. This app is so easy to use and 
there are so many fun pictures I can create. I would recommend downloading 
this for anyone I know."
4,"July 14, 2018"," I am the one of the user who using photodirector from last 2 or 3 years His 
blur tool isn't work well And PLZZ add a erase tool like PicsArt if u added 
that your app will be superbest editor for Android"
4,"July 11, 2018"," I like this app. You can do a lot of tricks with it like mirrors, colorpop, 
filters, etc. One improvement for the app is to allow people to go back 
steps after editing a pic."
2,"July 8, 2018"," Whenever I'm editing a picture, it crashes and I have to start all over 
again"
5,"July 16, 2018"," I just started using this app and I like it, am still learning.it's 
interesting."
4,"July 10, 2018"," Can be difficult in the learning curve if you want your teenagers to be 
comfortable using it. Otherwise, it is similar to many other quality photo 
editing apps."
5,"July 15, 2018"," This app is so easy to use versatile, and user friendly. Go for it!"
4,"July 9, 2018"," Best editing features on a phone app yet but navigation can be occasionally

for me. I recommend it to anyone looking for editing powers right at your 
fingers tips."
5,"July 15, 2018"," Very easy to use, quick results. On the go. Saves me tons of time."
5,"July 16, 2018"," My main goal is to crop and resize pictures. I did adjust the saturation on 
one shot. The app is doing everything I expected."

improvements in the two years."

impressed with this program's ability to execute time consuming complex 
tasks quickly with a near professional result. I have learned that using 
high quality photos yeilds a much better outcome with this program, and 
would definitely consider purchasing other apps from CyberLink!"
5,"June 2, 2018"," I had a photo of my most active dog, who was recently attacked and killed 
by a group of dogs. All the photos I had were too dark. This program helped 
me transform the pictures of my fur baby into lovely photographs."
5,"June 6, 2018"," I love photo director app a lot, it's awesome. But when i choose removal 
feature, it doesn't really work well. After I eliminate something or 
someone it leaves a smudge on the photo."
4,"May 25, 2018"," Like it a lot. Just one thing regarding the Cut out, the cut areas is too 
edgy can it be fix or be smooth after editing? Thanks."
4,"May 30, 2018"," This app is pretty good and cool. But you do have to pay for some things 
but they are not really needed, so its good."
5,"May 26, 2018"," Think about everything that you want in a photo editing app. PhotoDirector 
has got you covered! It's so fun to use, and it allows you to utilize many 
different tools."
2,"May 25, 2018"," A recent update seems to have ripped most of the camera filter 
functionality out of it in favour of paid for filters. Absolutely no need 
for me to ever touch this program again."
1,"May 27, 2018"," I love this app but you guys are telling me for 20 bucks you guys can't let 
me at least share my contact with 5 other users....... REALLY"
3,"May 23, 2018"," Meh, Toolwhiz is just as good, but 100% free, but this app...... wow, 
expensive effects!"
5,"May 28, 2018"," It's the best editing app in editing(for me) not only having many edit 
option, but it can also be used offline"
4,"May 28, 2018"," I think it is great! It takes time to master but I find that it is worth 
it. I have created some really nice pictures with this app. üòÄ"
4,"May 29, 2018"," It's a nice photo editor, it's missing some of the basic features though 
(e.g. Adding another picture to the current one)"
5,"June 4, 2018"," Ummm it's perfectly possible that you can use the selfie and more good than 
bad as I thought you are not going to be here for a little bit of a man 
girl I'm a adult that cleans up 6TH and the selfie with my first 6TH THE 
Lol please"
5,"June 2, 2018"," If you are looking for a photo editing app that works fast, basically no 
adds, total control, cool effects and great filters then you have found the 
perfect app. I use it for selfies and editing art even!"
5,"June 23, 2018"," ""All the oher photo editors are just about the same, this one stands out 
and is very easy and fun to use....."" was my response from when i first got 
this app a few years back and these words still remain true to this very 
day and beyond"
5,"May 24, 2018"," I LOVE this app! As a freelance photographer I've tried tons of editing 
apps and this is by far my favorite!"
5,"May 26, 2018"," I like to be able to edit my photos by writing on them or highlighting. My 
old Samsung native photo app did that but not on my Google Pixel 2. This 
app allows me to do all of it and more!"
5,"May 26, 2018"," Thanks this is excellent better than the other apps I've used so far I'll 
give 100%"
3,"May 31, 2018"," Looks like the Free version limits us to one ""Crop"" operation per day. 
That's what I found out when I made a mistake, tried again, but my
