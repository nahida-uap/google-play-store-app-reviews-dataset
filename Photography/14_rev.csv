lower than a 10 year old smartphone or $50 digital camera. Reduced by at

JPEG which has been compressed to lowest quality. Yes, I have looked at the 
same image on my computer and it looks just fine. Too bad, this used to be 
a good application when I last used it several years ago. I'd use Adobe 
Lightroom CC but am not ready to move my photos from Google Drive to Adobe 
Cloud. So for now, just want to find a photo browser that can browse raw 
images at full quality even if no editing capability. Since a ChromeBook 
display cannot be color calibrated, serious (but non-professional) editing 
is useless. But not interested in an app that makes my images look like 
they were drawn with crayons."
