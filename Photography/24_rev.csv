It's amazing for making picture collages, adding stickers, etc. Can be used as birthday/christmas present for friends or family or just for fun!

Its just a bit annoying when I try to make a picture frame larger than another and the picture juat disappears until I tap that frame again. It then get muck up because of this. Maybe make an option for when we want to make a particular frame bigger instead of me accidently moving it and stuffing the entire collage up
2,"November 7, 2017"," Besides having too many pop-up ads, I have to dang near beat my phone up to select a photo. Very annoying and not worth the time &  effort especially for something that's supposed to be fun. Uninstalling to find something better."

4,"August 9, 2017", This app is great I was searching for apps and apps and apps for a collage and I have this forever now there is one problem tho it's sometimes my pics leave or Blur out but that's okie it's still a great app !!!!😆
3,"July 2, 2017", It's cool.  Has a lot of layouts but for some reason it's hard to add pics to it. I'll tap or hold down on the space and it still won't move. May it's my phone but I decided to get a different app.

1,"May 17, 2017", This uses disruptive ads that pop up even when you aren't using the app. Way more ads than value to the app.
1,"May 16, 2017", YOU SUCK!!! EVERY 2 FRIGGIN' SECONDS AN AD POPS UP BEFORE I CAN EVEN TAP ANYTHING!!! TAKE OFF THE FRIGGIN' ADS ALREADY!!! GOD ALMIGHTY!!!!!!
4,"May 16, 2017", Good and fit for purpose. Does what it says on  the tin basically. A bit difficult to fit some pictures into some of the frames but you'll find your favourites that work.
2,"May 20, 2017", Way too many ads.  I'm fine with ads but this app takes it to a level that makes you not even want to open it.
2,"May 14, 2017"," When I tap to include photos, it won't open up to add them. Makes app non-functional"

1,"May 22, 2017", Will not let me add photos.   Help link is useless
5,"May 25, 2017", I think this app is great because you can combine memories and images into one and it doesn't take that much space.
5,"May 16, 2017", Really simple to use. No problems so far 👌 Perfect for putting pictures into frames. There's a wide range of frames to choose from
