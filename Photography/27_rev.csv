ease of using it. The only thing bugging me is when you zoom in it only 
zooms into centre and you can't zoom focus on edges to do detail editing.

think. Just be sure to keep the ease of use."

and supporter of the lightX app, I do not know the devs but they have been 
razor sharp on our suggestions as users of the app, some may say consumers, 
im a premium ad free paying member and any issue ive had they have promptly 
taken care of. I would still like to see some better support for HD quality 
as i was assured it to be coming and for months...has not. I still come in 
with hq image, do my editing and leave with a lower quality image, 
especially on cutouts, making your own stickers. Crashes from time to time, 
which does irritate once youve worked hard on a project, but the updates 
have been helping. Still tied for #1with toolwiz, and photodirector as the 
best free and premium image editing apps that are taken seriously. Snapseed 
blend with lightx would blow the roof off and claim the crown. Lightx- fix 
th HDef issue and youve won my friends. Now, to any reviewer that leaves a 
3star review or even 4 and use the word ""best"" or ""great"" in there 
description, guve the devs the credit they deserve, thats classless to hold 
a star in an attempt to get something not practical put into the app in 
order to get a fifth star. Use your stars based on what the devs say it can 
do and does it, the effort in updates of trying the new things asked for, 
and whether they are diligently working on all bugs, app crashes, as well 
as new content free and pay. Dont lowball a great app because they cant 
find the ""real bigfoot"" or ""yeti"" and take pictures to make stickers, thats 
just stupid. Give em the 5 stars theyve deserved from day one, and enjoy a 
free app. Or pay a small fee and enjoy even more. They will be the one 
standing on the mountain in the end, i
