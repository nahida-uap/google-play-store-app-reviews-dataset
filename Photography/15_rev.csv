4,"July 4, 2018"," I like it, but it's a little tricky to get it into Google photos to make a 
collage. I also wish there were more settings I could change + Snapseed has 
more settings. It's also easier to get a picture from Snapseed 2 Google 
photos. You might want to work on those two things!"
1,"July 4, 2018"," Trash. Does nothing unless one joins Adobe creative cloud. App is designed 
to lure users into adobe's service billing ecosystem as many companies are 
doing. I'll look elsewhere for a stand-alone app that will work even when 
I'm out of internet range. Uninstalled."

4,"July 1, 2018"," Love the app for editing. Having issues with creating collages. If I make 
one with 2 or 3 photos its fine. If I go to 9, the app crashes right as its 
saving to my phone so I lose all work. Goes back to editing but just a 
black screen."
1,"July 15, 2018"," Pretty pathetic excuse for photoshop. It is a good app if you have no 
intention of doing any of the work yourself. Every cookie cutter premade 
basic looking filter is only a click away."

think almost anyone could use this app the first time they opened it."

able to find a lot of things."
