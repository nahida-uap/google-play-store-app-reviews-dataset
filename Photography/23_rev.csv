1,"June 12, 2018", I can't even get to the app. It also added two app that I have to fight my way through each time I try to use my phone. What is the point? It also tracks activities to share with advertisers. Done and uninstalling immediately!!!

I've tried to adjust the settings and app permission, but it somehow gets around that.

1,"April 4, 2018", Why is this stupid app changing my settings without my permission and allowing ads to show up all over my phone! I know it's this app because they started showing up as soon as I downloaded it. And the settings continue to change even when I shut them off
1,"April 11, 2018"," Why do you need access to my text messages and other things?! It's a photo editing app. Only thing you NEED access to is my photos. Nope, I'm passing. üëé"

also a shortcut function that is opened when you swipe from one of the 
bottom corners. This is a PHOTO EDITOR. It is NOT a settings adjuster or a

permission and I have no idea why it is still on the market."

3,"January 26, 2018", It's fine but when I opened up my phone it had a thing to slide and unlock which my phone doesn't have. It looked like an ad. I deleted this app and the thing stopped! I think this app caused that. Please fix
1,"January 26, 2018", This app has wonderful features I enjoyed a lot of them. The problem is you never get to use them because there's always a commercial in the way. Then when I'm working on other things on my app out of nowhere and start popping up. I'm sorry but I'm trying to do artwork and you're getting in my way. ...Full ReviewThis app has wonderful features I enjoyed a lot of them. The problem is you never get to use them because there's always a commercial in the way. Then when I'm working on other things on my app out of nowhere and start popping up. I'm sorry but I'm trying to do artwork and you're getting in my way. Technology is not supposed to control you. You control technology. Would technology controls you that's called slavery. So makers of the app I have a question: Do you believe in karma? Because what you do to the public will come back to you tenfold. I will say you have made a beautiful wonderful app that does incredible things but I will not stand for all these ads.
1,"January 21, 2018", I liked it at first but then it just started like using my memory and kind of like giving me a virus on my phone NEVER DOWNLOADING EVER AGAIN..
1,"January 21, 2018", Nothing to do with photo editing. Just a bunch of Instagram filters and built-in phone correction
1,"January 16, 2018"," Couldn't stand it. Ads everywhere, the opinions are super confusing and it downloaded and entirely new app when I opened teh canera."
