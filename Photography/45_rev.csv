using it wrong. Please consider allowing the user to preview the original 
and the post filter. Right now I'm sliding the ""100"" slider to see the 
original and the added filter. Another feature I'd like to see is the 
rotate feature not only rotate in 90 degree increments. I do love the crop 
feature, user friendly and allows for manual cropping and aspect ratio 
cropping. A slight glitch is sometimes when I go to filter the (filter 
example/preview) is blanked out. Also the editing feature like ""exposure"" 
or ""contrast"" etc could do with a reset button to go to zero rather than 
sliding it back to the middle. Thank you :) but otherwise, love it."

4,"April 13, 2018", It's great! I wish there was a way that it helps you see when it's straight on the sides when you are trying to make it fill the screen a little more. Only issue I have with it
1,"April 13, 2018", Im really disappointed bc i downloaded it for previewing my grid of Instagram and replacing pics like on ios but I can't do that here... Hated it add that future to Android asap.

3,"April 14, 2018"," Was my goto app for resizing photos for Instagram. Now wants a monthly fee 
for filters. It's absolutely the developer's right to choose the direction 
they want to take, but I'll find another app that will resize photos 
without asking $3.99 a month."
5,"April 14, 2018"," Its alright but its not great, less ads and we'll be alright yeah"

months. You've lost your mind."

use to edit my photos and I am very proud to promote the app bec it really 
satisfies me. I would love to experience more of it."

that is just my opinion."

loved that on the ios version"
4,"April 15, 2018"," Like other comments that say the same. Yes, apps earn and you didnt make it 
for free but there are other waus ypu can earn. Dollars for filters doesnt 
make sense at all. But i still use it. Thanks. 5 star if it was for free. I 
dont have to tell you how an app earns. üëç"

Having to find and reopen back the gallery i was on every damn time is just annoying. People dont like repetitive stuff like this, especially when you are editing a lot of pics at the same time.

5,"March 4, 2018"," I absolutely love this app. Not only can you edit pictures , you can make collages, make pictures to fit on Instagram so you can see the entire picture (I hate when I go to upload a picture on Instagram and it never shows all I want it too )"
1,"February 24, 2018", I signed up for the free trial but you cost me 60 pesos! Give me a refund!
1,"March 1, 2018"," Used to use this app on iOS, but when they switched it up and included the crazy amount of ads and steps needed to export photos I've given up using it and found better, non subscription alternatives. Fix your app. By design they're supposed to make things easier, not harder."
1,"March 8, 2018", It said free trial but then charged me $3.99 US dollar.... not sure.... scam maybe
5,"March 3, 2018"," This is an excellent photo editor with much to offer such as many backgrounds,  collage options, and very easy to use.  I love it especially for  my instagram page."
4,"February 26, 2018"," Tento colocar a foto com bordas, mas tipo, tem que tentar alinhar se n√£o fica desalinhado e da muito trabalho. Gostava das vers√µes antigas que era s√≥ colocar do jeito que queria, aumentar ou diminuir. Essas atualiza√ß√µes tem a op√ß√£o de girar e √© muito chato"
1,"February 22, 2018"," FIX. YOUR. BROKEN. APP. Payed for ad-free and haven't been able to avoid them since your second last update, thiers OBVIOUSLY something wrong if so many people are giving your hundreds of the same complain about these obnoxious 15 second sound adds. Your got to be kidding me with this BS."
2,"March 11, 2018"," All filters were free for use, now the best filters charge. Seriously unfortunate. It was the best editing app for me."
5,"March 12, 2018", Great app. Not gonna uninstall it and that is a compliment from a person who is quite critical about technology.
4,"February 28, 2018"," High def export isn't really high def, otherwise great for basic lighting and color edits"
5,"March 17, 2018"," I was an avid user until the update - the whole point of this app was that I didn't need to ""crop"" my photos. Don't know what happened to that, but I'm sourly disappointed & on the look for a new app to replace this one."
4,"February 28, 2018"," Its great, but my birthday filter isn't working. Every time I try to put in my birthday my keyboard doesn't pop up, copy and paste doesn't work either."
4,"February 22, 2018"," It's wonderful but honestly the ads kill the mood, unless I wanna pay for them to go away."
3,"April 1, 2018"," When it tells me to enter my birthday to unlock the filter,my keyboard won't pop up and the cursor stays frozen!"
1,"June 16, 2018"," Too many ads . When I export my photo into instasize from my gallery it 
will go into the app and load and then go blank ."
3,"March 3, 2018"," Em i think , can you make a blur effect for the photo because i like to take a picture of flower so em that it , please ... Can you ?"
2,"March 24, 2018", Since the update the photos rotate ever so slightly when you resize with 2 fingers. Makes it impossible to have straight photos
1,"March 15, 2018", So many ADs and my first photo on Instagram still didn't fit. Total waste of time
5,"March 20, 2018", Reupdated the app and it works great now  But my version doesn't have the stitch option.
5,"March 3, 2018", I do not know many details but I mostly use it so screen shots of my Pandora song can be shared on Instagram
1,"February 22, 2018"," New update is terrible, can't do anything but add filters. DELETED."
1,"February 24, 2018", Tried to get money every 3 seconds.  I hate junk like this.
1,"March 10, 2018"," Constant ads and subscription fee pop ups, difficult to use, awful."
4,"April 3, 2018"," Great app, the only thing is when I manually resize the photos I would prefer that the photos didn't move, just stay in a central position."
5,"April 29, 2018"," Still havent worked out how to save my images but the filters are second to 
none + the ability to scale the filters too. Using it for the matt white 
frames üëå"
3,"March 20, 2018"," I hate that it absolutely butchers the quality of the picture even when ""HD"" is on. Please fix this. PLEASE."
2,"March 8, 2018", Stupid I need to pay 3.99 a month to edit pictures to fit better on Instagram and make them look slightly better. Where is the free version?
5,"March 19, 2018"," I love this app. It resizes photos to the exact dimensions I want, and it has a ton of cool colored filters that I love. This has really helped my photos!"
5,"March 6, 2018", I really love the photo filters. They are really nice and I use them mostly on my instagram stories and they give me very nice outcome
5,"February 24, 2018", Its okay I just wish they could unlock the teeth whitening feature for free because that is what most of us really want...
1,"March 19, 2018", Constant ads and request for reviews are frustrating af

4,"March 7, 2018", All the filter colors are beautiful but images quality are seriously reduced through the app. Hope you guys can alleviate √≠t.
4,"February 23, 2018"," Hey, where is that video editing feature that you have shown in add"
4,"March 22, 2018", Es muy buena para editar tama√±os de fotos y algunos filtros. L√°stima que no haya para videos.

5,"March 13, 2018", Love this app. I use it a lot for collages and to crop. One of the easiest useful apps i could fine that works almost all the time.
1,"February 22, 2018", So many ads and i can't use the filters because it wants me to have the trial for the premium and other filters which i have to pay.

1,"February 18, 2018", Used to be the best app you could get for making perfectly sized photos for Instagram. Now unfortunately it forces you to pay monthly for its service when there are a hundred other apps you could get that do the same thing. Wouldn't mind a 1 time app purchase fee but they have lost all my business.

I DL the app to resize my photos w/o cropping to find out all it does is crop your photos with the ratio squares. Also not noted the instasizing option is only after purchased. Total waist of time there. I can get the same features w other apps free. Then the filter are OK! Even when I used a photo that fit in the square the pixels were horrible. THEN ontop the ads!!!! Total waist of time.

I dont understand the point of this. Also how come you started charging now to get the features that were free before??? Like normal sized TEXT... wow smh -.-
1,"February 4, 2018", I use to love this app but after all the updates it turned TERRIBLE! I can't even make a collage anymore. After every update this app gets more confusing and harder to use. I will be uninstalling and finding a different app.
2,"February 14, 2018"," What happened to the Collage maker? It's really uncomfortable to use now. I can't edit a picture alone, or change one of them when I already chose them. I want to crop one and I can't. It wasn't like this before."
1,"January 14, 2018"," Used to be good and now they want us to pay to use.  Once they pop up the premium option,  the whole damn app hangs and shuts down.  Effing annoying."
2,"February 10, 2018", This would be a great app but its so hard to zoom the pic into the white frame and align it- impossible to get it straight! Very timeconsuming. Why doesnt it align automatically?? Shame!!
1,"January 24, 2018", This app got worse. It's always ads ads ads and can't even save a damn photo. Don't install. Support no more.

It became an essential application for me and many of my friends ever since we heard about it. Only the fact that the background shades are not updated much, still has same old backgrounds that makes me go with a blank white almost every time. Also the new filters are cool,  yet it's a little overpriced."
2,"January 4, 2018"," The pixel resolution of images may remain the same after editing but, the compression is terrible, images get a lot less sharper. Not recommended üëé"
1,"January 6, 2018", Very bad app if you're using it for free. Would not recommend
3,"February 18, 2018"," I used this for 1 minute & the ads popped up.  I couldn't get rid of them, so, I got rid of the app."
1,"July 9, 2018"," The recent changes ruined this app for me and now requesting my permission 
to use my personal data so they can share with 3rd parties?! From 5* to 1*. 
What a shame."
1,"January 18, 2018", They make you review the app so you can Use it. There are a ton of free options out there that do the same thing
2,"January 13, 2018", If it's not bad enough you can't upload a full photo to Instagram and have to crop or download an app just for that...you get the app and it has the exact same problem that Instagram has.
1,"January 6, 2018", I've now downgraded my review to 1 star. I paid for this app. But now I am bombarded with constant ads for premium. I PAID TO BE AD FREE.
1,"January 7, 2018", Whenever i click on the app it does NOT open. please fix your app. i enjoyed it while it worked and would like to keep using it.
1,"January 24, 2018"," Used to use this app every now and then. All of a sudden there's no free version. Not worth it for me, disappointing."
1,"January 22, 2018", 1st thing this app does it let us take a trial for 7 days which you can't do it unless you pay after 7 days. Un installing
1,"January 10, 2018", Way to many ads .. Can't even use the free version without them asking to upgrade to premium a million times
4,"January 23, 2018", Great app. However of late its been freezing and I need to delete it and then I've lost all my layouts. Other than that great app.
1,"February 2, 2018", I used to love this app... I got a new phone. I install then uninstall and it keeps saying cannot play video and it freezes
5,"February 20, 2018", I am giving this mobie photo editor 5 stars. This is just awesome. My instagram feed and generally all the pictures that I share to my social accounts look unique with the photo effects provided by Instasize.
5,"January 14, 2018"," Must have for me every phone, even without the paid for filters still a great useful app. Keep it up!"
3,"February 14, 2018"," I used to enjoy this app very much but now after recently downloading again, as soon as I open the app ""video cant be played"" comes up and doesnt allow me to close that bubble or use the app. Please fix asap and rating will go to 5 stars(:"
4,"January 20, 2018"," The app is a wonderful app, however very very slow. I've done every update and it's still slow. Keep that in mind when downloading this app."
5,"February 15, 2018"," It's was great but the update is annoying, where is the black Radio filter? Pls change back or something"
1,"March 5, 2018", I liked the previous version of this app. This app is annoying.
2,"February 15, 2018"," A shocking amount of adverts, they're timed exactly right to fool you too, mine sometimes comes up with a square over my pictures that stops them sharing too. It seems they want you to pay for premium otherwise get hounded with terrible adverts. I"
5,"January 10, 2018"," Great cz allows to resize pic elegantly. Give more usable free filters. Too less, too basic so little or no use."
1,"January 15, 2018", This is used to be good. It is just a basic photo editor and it asks for a ridiculous monthly subscription.
5,"January 6, 2018", I am not just saying  for the app but this is the best app but you do have to pay if you want more stuff
1,"February 7, 2018", i had loads of photos saved on their and now you have updated it their all gone all my memories i carnt get back im heart broken is they anyway i can get them back üò¢üò¢üò¢
1,"February 20, 2018", Way too many excessive commercial ads contained within this application. And when you report the issue. They ask for screenshot. Ads might not appear when user takes screenshot üòÆüî´ #da. #WTH
5,"January 18, 2018"," At first i was facing some difficulties and gave a bad rating but just after three days of my rating devs updated the app and everything is working fine, so i m updating my rating too"
3,"January 8, 2018", Always had a lot of us out of this app but why have you changed it? Why have you removed and changed the fonts?
1,"January 28, 2018"," I spent a bunch of money on filters, they start shoving premium in my face still. Moved to a new phone can't even transfer the filters."
5,"February 20, 2018"," This is my favourite app, my go to photo editing app for Instagram, there are so many beautiful photo filters available even on the free account that give my pics a special vibe. I give the app 5 star also for being very easy to use."
2,"January 20, 2018", A mess! This update has a lot of videos and makes it harder to select a collage. Please go back to the original format.
1,"January 28, 2018", Ads. Ads. More ads. Slow. And hangs and glitches all the time.
5,"January 17, 2018", Easy to use. Solved my Insta sizing problems.
3,"January 15, 2018", Before i would have given it a five...but whatever got taken from the fonts broke my heart
1,"January 21, 2018"," This app is terrible now, idk what they think they're offering that makes it worth paying 5 bucks a month lol"
5,"February 21, 2018"," A big thanks to the team working on instasize, this app is amazing, I am very thankful that you can continuously  and some new filters and features and that they are so easy to use"
1,"February 6, 2018", Used to be perfect but the premium is too expensive! A monthly payment or yearly? All that for new filters and no ads?  Fml
3,"June 23, 2018"," I liked the older version better where you could switch your photos in you 
collage and pic how many slots you wanted in your collage you can't even 
double tap to change your pics out anymore üòí"
5,"January 15, 2018", I just use it for the arts fartsy white frame that hipsters use on Instagram and I luuuuv itttt
2,"January 16, 2018"," It was working fine for me for years,  until I did an update recently and now when I click on it, nothing happens. I wrote to the developers and have gotten no response in over a week."
3,"February 16, 2018", Don't want to buy full version but it's without it so bad
3,"January 30, 2018"," Keeps saying ""can't playing video"" won't let me back out of it. Annoying."
1,"February 10, 2018", I use this app for one purpose... It works for getting things to fit in Instagram but I have to watch an ad to do such a simple task.......
3,"February 9, 2018", Mine kept hanging anytime am editing and its goes off...its annoying
1,"February 4, 2018", Tem um programa bom mas sem condi√ß√µes de t√™-lo!!! Cada vez que vou salvar uma foto aparece an√∫ncio. Simplesmente n√£o consigo salvar a foto ppor causa do maldito an√∫ncio. Vou excluir esse APP s√≥ por caisa disso
3,"January 4, 2018", Too many ads & always loading a few times before I can finally post
4,"January 28, 2018", A lot of adds. But it's free so... can't exactly complain!
4,"January 21, 2018", I think it's a great app for like photo edits and stuff. Really wish you didn't have to pay for the full thing though....that's like the only downside of this app.
1,"March 13, 2018", I lost Amount from my account as subscription without even asking for a confirmation. I didn't even receive any confirmation OTP before transaction. Rs 260 was debited from account mentioned as Munkee apps.
4,"February 21, 2018"," Works well, ads can be a bit annoying though."
1,"January 25, 2018", It just shuts down wothout even opening it.
3,"January 21, 2018", It's good to post fullsize pic without crop bt for only single pic & thts üëéüëé. So plzz. Add feature for post multiple pics at the same time.
2,"February 4, 2018"," Todo estaba bien hasta que aparecieron los anuncios y tener que pagar para tener mejores filtros, ya no los amo.üíî"
1,"February 11, 2018", Too many really invasive ads. Not that many features.
1,"January 29, 2018", Bought a new phone and dowloaded.. now asking for a payment and username. I have too many accounts to keep up with as it is..looking for an alternative.. any suggestions
5,"February 15, 2018", I love this app. The free filters are awesome I just wish there were more free ones. But otherwise yes I've been using this app for years.
5,"January 9, 2018", Has just what u need without taking up a toooooon of space.  Especially like the photo/blur background options and the new edits.
5,"February 19, 2018", My go to app on all the occasions.  I keep receiving  complements on my instagram feed. It also gives an extra vibe to my videos
5,"January 11, 2018", Great app but i hate the pop ups to many.
4,"January 5, 2018"," Nice App but, need more border options.  Let's get ""creative""..."
5,"February 11, 2018"," Always use this to post my photos in their full, original frame. Super useful, especially for multi-photo posts on Instagram."
5,"January 17, 2018"," Just reviewing so I don't get that stupid ad no more, but it's cool"
1,"February 10, 2018", This used to be good but you can piss off if you think I'm paying for it
4,"February 6, 2018", I like it it ia well made but my question is how can you make a blurred border
3,"February 11, 2018"," Its really good for creating white borders on Instagram but it doesn't do the same thing for videos, videos aren't even an option."
1,"February 26, 2018", Immediately cut off the peasky my pulse üòàüòàüòà
4,"February 2, 2018", It's VERY GOOD but resently it's been a little laggy but I think that's my phone but this app is good!!
1,"February 2, 2018", It want let me share my photos. I'm being directed straight to adds üò†
5,"January 19, 2018", so i've been finding an apps that can grid my photo with fixed size and this has been the best apps ever ‚ù§
4,"January 12, 2018", Ads are annoying but worth it.
5,"January 23, 2018", Easiest app for photographers who don't want their photos cropped when posting them to Instagram. It's perfect.
5,"March 18, 2018", I like this app so much.. it make my photos editing to next level n make my editing easy... Thnk u so much
5,"January 18, 2018", It's the best app for editing but it still lacks some features which are present in apple but not in Android!
1,"February 7, 2018", Now i have to pay for all the filter even when I just need one of them?
5,"January 6, 2018", Really like how it can download the full picture
4,"January 6, 2018", Way too many ads
1,"March 3, 2018", Worst. Asking money for everything.
4,"January 20, 2018", I'll definitely buy this app but paying a every month it's ridiculously
5,"February 10, 2018", This is my go to app for getting my full size images in Instagram. Easy to use and plenty of features.

5,"January 29, 2018", Still trying to get images to fit in my story.
5,"March 2, 2018", So many options to choose from! Works like a charm every single time.
5,"February 19, 2018"," Only good experience,therefore, 5 star with a plus.The filters are unique and very much appealing"
3,"January 8, 2018"," Seriously, make a simple paid version & I'd be happy. None of this subscription stuff"
4,"February 4, 2018"," Does what I need. I wish there was a batch option, though."
5,"February 3, 2018", Everything in one app
4,"February 2, 2018", This app is fun and pretty easy to use. Maybe some stickers would help

They are disturbing me while editing some photos. Can you make the ads disabled or just remove it permanently. Please reply me?
