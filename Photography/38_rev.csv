So I will not tell you if you should, or should not get this great looking  app. But I will say, since I am downloading it now, it is taking a while to download!! So be patient when you get this app. Unless it us just me!!!!!!! Have a nice day. Or nignt!"
2,"February 4, 2014","What You cant save the photo to your device. So you edit the photo and it is a waste of time. I suggest not geting the app unless you want to push one button to edit a photo. And you can mix the editing, you can only use one"
1,"December 10, 2013","NonStop Stream of Ads Nothing but adverts, prompts for ads and an irritating streaming line of adverts non stop at bottom of screen. Even worse, photo editing is very limited.  Pixler is way better & NO irritsting ADs"
1,"January 6, 2014",Awful This app wouldn't let me save the picture and it didn't have a wide variety of options.  I'd give it 0 stars if possible
1,"February 24, 2014",Terrible Shite  app. Does not even open all the way before the error messages start. Immediate uninstall.
1,"March 27, 2014",Don't get it! This app is so bad!! It wouldn't let me edit anything and if it did it would freeze for ages.
1,"December 25, 2013",Can't open any pictures Simply crashes on latest kit kan. Would give 0 stars of it was possible.
1,"October 27, 2013",Horrible... Force closes when I apply filter. Wont let me undo effects
1,"May 6, 2014","Same old, same old. I just want something that allows layers."
1,"June 2, 2014",Too simple I really dont like this app they have reallh basic effects and its very slow and sometimes it doesnt work if.
2,"April 5, 2014",Fairly Gud app But its a kind of sluggish n unsteadiness
1,"December 12, 2013",R U kidding... Some poor schmuck gave this app 5 stars back in November without even trying it. Ill never believe a review ever again!
5,"February 24, 2014",Photo app I am going to get the best way to get your free account. If you have any questions or concerns about the same time.
2,"January 22, 2014","&gt;:( !!! Every time I tried to edit a photo, the app would just close and not save anything. The reason I gave it 2 stars, however, is because it is a fairly good app. Besides the evertything part. Just fix that and you deserve 5 stars."
1,"January 17, 2014",Horrible Constantly force closes and hasn't allowed me to send any pics. Not worth the hassle.  Deserving of 0 stars
1,"March 26, 2014","worst app ever unless you want disappointment, don't download this!"
1,"October 13, 2013",Not into it It didn't work for me as good as I wanted it to you.. All the effects are in every other photo editor...
3,"October 7, 2013","Good, but... It doesn't work very well for the nexus 7...it takes a while to apply a filter, and there aren't many options to choose from...but not a bad app overall, just some minor adjustments would be nice"
5,"April 26, 2014", Good app but text k different style option nahi hen.. & frames b achy nahi hen.
5,"October 19, 2013",Best pic edit app Love what I can do with this picture app. I use it mostly for my contact list cause I love the superhero look and for imstagram. Its the best way to.put my feelings into my pictures. Love it and you will too!
1,"February 20, 2014",Crashes Crashes as soon as I try to select a photo to edit. Don't waste your time like I wasted mine.
1,"November 16, 2013","Horrible Every time I click a photo, nothing comes up! Crashes every time I click an effect."
2,"March 31, 2014",Extremely basic its boring I suppose it would be ok for a child or 1st time user of of an editing app but not for me. Thanks
1,"March 12, 2014","DO NOT DOWNLOAD! Can't even do the basic features you would expect it to do! No crop, no photo contrast or red eye functions. Very poor photo effects. Worst photo edit app ever!"
1,"October 22, 2013","What a terribly slow app with terrible Ad Spam! The app is slow, does not offer anything any other app could do as well and is spaming me with ads now."
1,"March 3, 2014","Save/export does not work on Nexus5 Export to Gmail -&gt; Gmail abort ... other exports just do nothing. I started painting with a white screen, not a photo."
1,"September 10, 2013",Worse thing ever This app send you a lot of publicity and stop instantly i was not possible to create not even one photo
5,"February 1, 2014","Great app This app has very useful features. The thing is, it is built with very low memory with high options."
2,"March 21, 2014",Fine Not much features are added.You can only do few changes in your pics.editing is very easy but not very attractive.so I am happy to give only 2 stars for this app.... ;-)
1,"September 3, 2013",Horrible This app is so horrible it's not even worth one star but it won't let me give it none.
2,"November 13, 2013",o O Thchjufd ghhddj hub inhuman Byrne Hhju Hyr Gift
3,"November 10, 2013","No contrast? I wish you could adjust the contrast, that's the main thing I want to do with a photo editor."
1,"September 22, 2013",Terrible Wont let me go back if i don't want an effect dont waste your time plus wont let me choose were i want the effect don't get it
5,"September 7, 2013",ads annoying ads.. but good
1,"September 30, 2013", Kept coming up with adverts then crashing when I tried to click out of them! Waste of time! Very annoying!
1,"December 22, 2013",Terrible Slow and does not provide anything else that other free apps with no ads provide.
5,"November 7, 2013",I'm not sure what to do it The following pages of the most important part of the day

3,"December 29, 2013"," Its very good so far, my only problem is the continuous ads, and it takes WAY to long to apply a filter, fix these, or I will be uninstalling this app"
