1,"June 2, 2018"," If only the eraser work I'll give it a five star or four star it has lack 
of colors and the Eraser doesn't work so if you paint anything and you mess

your app"
5,"June 15, 2018"," I love this app! I have used it on every device since forever and it is my 
go-to photo editor app!"
5,"July 12, 2018", Very good
5,"May 27, 2018", Using it for recent years
5,"May 25, 2018"," It's brilliant for colouring B&W photos I've used it for a few years now. 
It does take practice to get a good result however the app is called Photo 
""Art"". Like any art work close up all you can see is brush strokes. This is 
a great app that's why I give it 5 stars."
5,"December 29, 2017"," Best app for adding effects to a specific part of a photo.  U can use brush mode to ""paint"" a selected effect anywhere on a photo.

If u want that cool out of focus background look, just select a blur effect and ""paint"" the areas u want to look out of focus.  If its confusing at first just keep playing with it and you'll figure it out.  Its not that complicated."
2,"April 7, 2018", No intelligent design here. No easy color selection tool. You manually use a brush to paint on the alpha channel adding color back in or erasing color which can get tedious especially in small areas.
1,"August 17, 2017", It's very hard to get into small places like around the face or body with out it affecting the picture. Like making the background black and white and make just the object just have color. Very confusing and not user friendly.
5,"December 5, 2016", Great editing tool. The nearest thing is far behind. Really earns five stars. Small size but very capable. Good work.keep it up! (Please include crop in the next update.)
2,"January 17, 2017","How does this work Not allowing me to choose a color and just apply to one part of picture.  No instructions,  confusing,  and works more in reverse which is stupid.    I do not recommend as there are many better apps out there."
5,"February 22, 2017"," I use this app with another photo editor app. This app is perfect for what I create. It's simple and easy to use. Should have more than 3.8 stars and if you're creative like I, you should have zero issue's with this application. Thank You for cresting this app!"
4,"July 18, 2016",It was fun The only thing I didn't like was when you delete it it deletes all of your saved photos out of the gallery from the app.
5,"October 29, 2016",Better then ever It's so 😎 cool it better then you prbly jk but it might be.love the app plus don't down load rodlox it will make you sick but only the good games on rodlox you can play by so you know..........
5,"October 28, 2016",Too Good To Be True Cant believe I can do every photo edits easily with this app! Really wish I could get a Samsung Note 8 and for sure will sync with this app better!
3,"October 16, 2017", Its actually an awesome app but the one problem is a big one. Sometimes my images import sideways and I can flip up & down them but not rotate them😥
5,"August 4, 2016",Best app ever There is nit a lot of adds and the fetures are amazing not dificult to use . I could use it for a lot of other stuff. GET THIS APP😀
1,"August 22, 2016",Keeps Stopping and Crashing Every time I get half way through doing my picture it crashes and I have to start all over again.
1,"May 8, 2016","This app Hit the back button on accident and your while picture edit gets erased. Congrats, you've wasted and hour of your life. Why doesn't this app ask you to exit before you exit?!"
5,"October 13, 2016","Nice This is a really good app, especially, since it's free. It's really more about how creative you are. Discovering my hidden talents of photo manipulation & I like what I'm able to do Good job."
2,"May 17, 2016",Can't save After editing i try to save to gallery but i keep getting the same error message saying cant save to gallery and it wont even let me take a screenshot VERY ANNOYING!
1,"April 18, 2017", I only took 1 picture and it told me my memory was full effects were crap. I only had it on my phone 5 minutes couldn't take more of ot.
2,"August 15, 2016","Could be better It's okay for very basic edits, but you can't select any colors of your choice to ""paint""  a photo. The colors are automatically selected for you. Add this feature and I'll gladly give 5 stars."
5,"August 15, 2016","Great app! It take patients, but I've downloaded lots of photo apps and this one is one of my favorites!"
1,"February 10, 2017", Simple tool! First it makes your color pix to BnW image. Then you may color any portion of pix.
1,"January 19, 2017", It is really crap. There is no draw mode Hated it so much
3,"January 26, 2018"," I dont know why but it was working great but then when I click ""get photo from gallery"" it used gets something randomly instead of me picking PLEASE FIC IT"
1,"May 21, 2017", Rubbish... doesn't allow you to choose filter colour.  Same as orher rubbish appa.
5,"December 29, 2016",This need to be on the App Store for Iphone Users I really love this but im switching to an Iohone and Photo Art isnt on the App Store. PLEASE OUT ON APP STORE.

5,"January 29, 2016",Curser Offset Can you PLEASE add cursor offset? It's really hard to be precise when your finger is bigger than the brush...please add a way to offset it so that the brush is above your finger (maybe add an outline of the brush too so we can see where the brush is)

3,"August 17, 2014","Ok once you get used to it Once I understood the paint/erase/zoom button's triple function. But I can't find an *undo* function, so it makes this program hard to use (unless you're a robot who always  gets everything right the first time)"
5,"September 26, 2014",Awesome editor This is the best editing app I've found and none compare. Most people are to lazy to find out how you use it but once you do it is by far the best. Also gonna say a good app to use with this is Photo grid collage maker. Adds the minimum stuff your unable to do on this.

However it's useless because my original photo is from a Nikon D800 camera 36mp. When I save to my photo gallery it totally reduces the size to 70KB which sucks big time. Anyway to edit and save to gallery at original size so I can upload to my website? I'm a professional wedding photographer and this would be great if you fixed this problem.
2,"July 16, 2014",Ehhhh... Not that great it doesn't let me paint at ALL so.... it just let me change the effect... don't download if u want more than just paint and effects not that great... I give it 2 stars.... UNINSTALL!
3,"November 8, 2014",This was so awesome but now...... I LOVED this game I played it heaps but now as I choose a picture the screen just goes ALL black!! Even though it says its fixed well its not on my tablet!! now I can't do anything.   :'(

Until then I'm uninstalling and if others care about details as much as I do I recommend you do the same.
1,"December 6, 2014",Black screen! Love this app but still black screen on my tablet. Used to be great. Redo your big fix please. Don't want to have to get rid of this app
5,"July 2, 2014",EDIT YO HEART THIS APP GETS ME OUT OF A LOOOOTT OF TROUBLE!
1,"October 28, 2014",Overrated Can't do what it shows in the store demo illustrations. Reduces resolution of files without asking permission.
1,"August 3, 2014", Very limited editing options... Very confusing... Photowonder is so much better... Haven't found one that beats it yet... Sorry but this app only deserves one star and that's being nice...
1,"October 17, 2014",The picture didn't show up It may be broken
4,"August 22, 2014",COLOR EFFECTS It's Dope and different
5,"July 1, 2014"," I have used this app to create some beautiful pictures.  For a person that has as much creativity as a finger nail, my pictures are taking on a whole new look with numerous compliments."
4,"August 10, 2014",Awesome So much easier to use then other editing apps. I don't use it much but it hasn't messed up at all!
5,"July 2, 2014",Awesome.... Its a very nice app...works perfectly. but i would only suggest that when editing a pic its resolution decreases.....That should not happen...
4,"December 1, 2014","Great but Brilliant app, having loads of fun with it. I would be willing to pay for a premium version, it would however need to be able to create higher resolution pictures, have more and easier control over panning and zooming, also remove ads"
1,"November 5, 2014",Even 1 * is too much for this application... The way of functions isn't compatible( similar ) with android phones...It's very complicated for so minor results on the end...  Waste of time for nothing
5,"August 23, 2014",Amazing I love this app 'cause it helps with faint pics..i drew a Pikachu with a pencil and took a pic but it was hard to see till i found this app fixed it now it looks perfect!!!! :-D
4,"July 3, 2014","Noo! There's a virus in app I just updated this app and my Trust Go security notified me, that there's some small virus or spam... [YT]PAUL-CZ™ ;)"
3,"September 1, 2014",Just ok!!! Would be even better if we could put captions on the pictures. However i love to use color on certain things on my pictures. Would give a higher rating.
3,"November 19, 2014",No zoom This is a cute app But it would be better if there was a zooming feature to help focus the color popping instead of ending up with a halo of color around the specific object you want to make pop
4,"October 17, 2014",Simple but Smart... I am Junior Zoologist...happy to see Salamander theme...bt i am impressed by the work of brush tool...it's a very fine app....
2,"July 6, 2014",Is it true??? I just read one of the rated comments and they said this app has a virus. Is it true? Have you fixed this problem?? I'm a little scared of downloading this app.
4,"October 2, 2014"," I'll rate 5 when there's an undo button...i was taking my time, 15 mins, and i press something i didnt mean to and boom. Gone"
1,"July 29, 2014", I cant even edit my picture like the one on the profile pic...i also want my pics to have black abd white effect with some snazzy read to make it hott
2,"July 6, 2014",Wasn't what I expected I hate when an apps icon has something amazing on it but when you try the app you can't even do what's on the icon.
1,"August 6, 2014"," Incredibly confusing, no instructions, no idea how to use it, intrusive ads. Uninstalled."
3,"August 16, 2014",Confusion. How do you color in certain things and keep the other things in the original color?
5,"October 28, 2014",Amasing Better than the tablet version of Photoshop its amazing and if I could I would give it more than 5 stars. Takes a some time but that's fine

5,"December 3, 2014",Definitely the best Using it on my galaxy s 3 it works perfectly and I have so much control with zoom and brush size . Love it .

4,"April 3, 2014","Awesome This is such an awesome little app. It took me a bit to figure out how to add just some color (Edit &gt; Original &gt; Paint Mode, choose brush, slide it around then zoom and erase parts you don't want colored) Needs a back option though."
5,"June 16, 2014","Great little app. My friend was the one who introduced me to photo art. At first I thought little of it, but when I was I bored curiosity got the better of me.

At first I thought little of it, but when I was I bored curiosity got the better of me. That led me to start tinkering with the features and boy oh boy did I find a gold mine! It's a fantastic application and does just about everything you need it to do in one little package. Absolutely love it."
4,"February 13, 2014",Its one great app Used to have this app before i switch to another phone. Stil has some issues with new os of camera. Will give 5 if they fix and make edited pics retain its pixel size if able. Thanks
5,"April 13, 2014","One of my favourite pic editing apps Sure it doesn't have filters and the customized frames, but it makes up for this in the details like blur/colour/saturate for only specific selected areas of a photo."
1,"May 18, 2014",Black screen when i pull up my picture. Its fustrating. I try to load my picture and it just comes up black screen. Then it shuts down. Crap so it gets a 1. Not even worth that as its not easy to work out how to use it 1st time around.
2,"January 26, 2014","One problem... Gallery photos turn to grayscale when a filter is applied. In its current state, the app is worthless. After a fix, easy 4 stars."
4,"June 25, 2014","Update? I love this app, but it would be better if it allowed you to save colors, adjust the smoothness of the paintbrush and have an undo button. I hate when I make a mistake I have to start over again."
5,"February 19, 2014",Awesome!! I see no bugs with this app. The heat and thermal are the best. I  think you stumbled onto something there. Best app I have installed yet.
5,"December 21, 2013","Excellent photo app!!! This app is so cool!! It has so many cool features; not just the fact that you can grey out the photo then color just what you want to highlight,  but so much more!!!"
3,"June 7, 2014","Good, but confusing Can you choose the color of the paint? If so, can you please tell me how. And if you can't, that's fine. Just tell me if you can or can't"
3,"June 20, 2014",Good. Great and easy to use. But only problem is it needs contrast and light adjustment added... I have to download Photoshop now to do that..
2,"January 1, 2014",Very cool but disappointing I like making pics look cool but the update did not work when I chose a pic from my profile pictures and the Screen turned black please update then I will change my  rating to a five because the app is still very cool
1,"May 12, 2014","Needs Directions I was trying to color an old black & white photo I have, but there are no options to choose a color, and no directions on how to do so, either. This would have been a neat app, but seeing as how user-UNfriendly it is, I must say the app is terrible."
5,"December 23, 2013",Best app ever This is my best photo editing app on my phone because its easy to use :) :) ;) <3 <3 <3
1,"April 25, 2014",Ick Obviously made for children. Not very good photo enhancer.  The effects are lazy at best.
1,"February 16, 2014","Confused I try to paint but it won't let me. It also doesn't tell you how you can. The only thing I could do was add effects. So... unless I'm told how to make it work, my review will stay at 1 star."
1,"December 19, 2013","Doesn't load stored pics Tried to use a picture I already had stored in my phone, all I got was a black screen. #uninstalling"
5,"December 24, 2013","Excellent! I just LOVE the effect they give, escpecially the one that has no colour and the one thing they're holding WITH colour <3"
