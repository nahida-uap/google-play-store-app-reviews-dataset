time now and it's easy to use with a TON of ways to edit photos, and 
there's attention to detail in just how precise you can be. People often 
think I used Adobe Photoshop on my edited photos, but nope, it's Picsart. I 
spent a long time downloading different photo editing apps and they didn't 
have much, but then I found this one and the search is over, it has 
everything. One thing that does bug me is that when trying to erase the 
background of a picture, you have to do it all manually. (For example, if 
there's a white background, you can't select the white background and 
delete it like in other apps. You have to erase it with your finger. I like 
the precision of manual erasing (And the ability to change the opacity and 
hardness for what you're erasing) but I'd love it if you could still have 
an auto select as well for a fast, easy edit.) Anyway, I can't really find 
much wrong with this app, just download it."

you removed that feature."
