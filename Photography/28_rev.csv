2,"September 5, 2017"," Don't really recommend it unless you're looking for something boring and uncreative. Instead of installing this, install Collage Maker Pic Grid or Photo Lab Pro, these are much more helpful when it comes to editing and simply making your photos nice, fun, and creative."
5,"August 26, 2017", Very easy to use. Use it to enhance pics from a trail camera where we caught someone on our property at 02:30. The tools allowed me to clean up the image for a positive ID
5,"September 11, 2017", Installed it today &  used it for an hour. Uninstalled the app I've been using for the last year & a half. Best free app available. As far as the adds go somebody has to pay  the bills. Better the advertisers than me!
5,"September 5, 2017"," It's not a bad app, I wish there was a better selection of stickers, frames and other things to add on to pictures. Other than that it's pretty good."

1,"July 4, 2017", The app is easy to use;  almost too basic for 2017 to be halfway over.  Every project I finished had some saving feature issue.  What this is a photo app if the save/  share functions don't work.  There's also no way to get help in the app.
4,"July 11, 2017", Great at first. But then It keeps saying 'cant load photo' every time i finish editing and want to save the photo. Ps. The meme option was great tho
5,"July 10, 2017", I never liked taking photos but since i got this app on my phone ive been enjoying editing every photo i take now im an instant photographer
5,"July 20, 2017"," I tried several apps and this one has the most complete futures to edit collages, add texts. I needed some practice to start getting it, still learning. Very good app so far."
