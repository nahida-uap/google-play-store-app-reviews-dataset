Also to those who are bothered by the tag in the lower right corner, you can also change the look of it by placing your finger over the tag/stamp and tap trough several different style of stamps.  Also you ARE able to resize and crop.  Plus  apply several different layers by simply saving, then pull pic again to add additional layers of your choice.  I have seen several complaints regarding these issues, I hope this helps."

3,"August 15, 2015","Really Good job Too much compression to photos, please make cropping option by user, bcoz some photos need bigger file and size. More rotate and resize option. Overall i love all filters. Please reply i love this app for photo editing. üôè"
2,"July 12, 2015","#BrightCam watermark on photo I can't remove watermark. :( But, good thing are (1) this camera automatically increase brightness when u snap. (2) The ""Glow"" filter & lens are girlie sweet."
4,"September 28, 2015",Good but It should allow filters more than one at a time and unique collage styles. The filtres also should have rotate options and fade away option for better result.
4,"August 8, 2015",1 more request I wish there is a way we can remove the Brightcam signature as it ruins the beauty of the frames and glows applied. Other than that I am so happy to be able to reinstall this app again on my phone.
2,"May 31, 2015","Cool filters, but no freedom. I like the app, but... You can not size, rotate, or move filters to fit picture.. Some of the filters go right over faces. If it could have the ability of photo studio pro I would buy it... Give more function and freedom to user and it would be a 5....."
5,"April 28, 2015",Can it be better?? No it's awesome Good very good but I think there should be a option for making collage also
2,"August 15, 2015",Great app But hate the logo so will use something else.
2,"July 8, 2015","Don't like the logos Is there a way to upgrade so you don't have the ""bright cam"" on all the frames?"
5,"August 17, 2015",good but when internet is off unfortunately its glows and frames disappear plzzz correct this mistake
5,"July 30, 2015",Best camera ever I love my friends are asking me how I get such good pictures I just tell then it is this app

Wish there were more events like birthdays options and more holidays. Would love to be able to add text to it with different font and color options. I use another app for that. But would be nice to have it all together
5,"July 24, 2014","Yaa, it is a good one... It has many new features than others but i think it should include much more new and more colours for editing which other apps are having... it is nt so bad also"

Only thing I'm missing is the option to add a text, but have another nice app for that so it's all right.

5,"July 31, 2014",Expensive! It would have been just great if all the frames in all categories were free! Buying them individually is a curse on the pocket!
4,"September 18, 2014","Micromax A27 Its very nice app but when i start to click a picture, report feedback appears everytime plz fix this bug. And add some more frames & effects."
5,"August 16, 2014",Cool App is very cool three days in and has not crashed or used bat there are alot of effects free and other more unique ones u need to pay for..
