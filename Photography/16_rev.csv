the tools but as with all things.. the payoff is equal to the investment."

video! Where is that app guys?"
5,"June 15, 2018"," I have been searching a long time for a nap and editor this good! And it 
don't leave stupid trade marks on your photos when finished! No watermarks 
at all unless you put them there! Love this app"
3,"May 13, 2018"," The app is fine to edit pictures but there are errors on the so called mask 
mode that I try to color a anime open mouth red, it ends up going off the 
outlines. I also want the brush system to be updated cause the thinnest 
brush is not even small at all which is a rip off"

pictures come out excellent. You can pay for extra features or not, You 
have so much fun editing your pictures.You can use this app. With out 
internet. 10 star app."

I don't see how anyone could give it anything but a positive review."

thank you for scamming a few donations and still add ads.... Lame."

this away by giving out 10 family codes when I paid $1.99, and then when 
one family code is used by someone, another 10 free codes are given anew to 
that person too. This means they are practically giving it away free

5,"April 15, 2018"," I've tried them all. Simply the BEST all-in-one photo editor. It gets 
better and better too! It can compete with not only every other all-in-one 
app, but also gives the single tool apps, like Background Eraser, Prisma, 
etc. all a run for their money. It's the one photo app I need"
5,"April 11, 2018"," It is in my opinion the easiest and most powerful to use. I have used many

filters, stickers etc. Best yet for 90% of my editing, I've deleted almost 
all of my other editing apps. My only suggestions are there should be a 
removal selection, where you can just select the area you want gone and 
presto. Also when it comes to slimming the body, there should be a way to 
manually do it, so you can selwct where and how much you want done because 
the way it is now doesn't work very well, just kinda makes the whole 
picture look thinner, there isnt one which to me is very important. I would 
also love to be able to do a manual when is comes to red eye removal, don't 
really understand how this one works? When I try it leaves a black spot. I 
think there should be more options on lens flare and light leak or at least 
an option to upload more. But all in all it's an amazing app that I will 
always use and I've been telling everyone I know to download it!!"

There are lot features that can be use but still can't satisfy me and I need to use other apps for editing. Here are my suggestions: *Patch and healing - why not doing it multiple times with the same adjustments? I hate it adjusting again and again. *Face tune - use only demabrasion or whitening in manual, I hate erasing all the background. Face detection of skin may help. *Makeup - I need to use makeup app in order to beautify your face. Having different hair, eyebrows, eye lens, lips, countour and etc.. *Blending and Layer - must have perspective positioning the image for example I want to replace the image in the billboard. *Different brushes - use to paint and add effects just like in photoshop. Another thing, some tools doesn't have a tutorial. A lot of improvement and additional tools will be nice and hoping this will the best app to all that I dont need to use other. :)"

I would also like a programme that physically resizes pictures not visually resizes pictures as not everyone has a good data package. I find the operation of this illogical and have wasted far more time on this than other apps only to lose everything I have done as it is completely unclear if it has saved or not. Rather than keep adding tools it would be a good idea to make it easy to use as it does my head in trying to find what I want in the metro interface and then losing it all when I have."

NO I WASN'T PAID, my name is Christopher David Mears and I approve this app; it is awesome sauce.  Google my social media peace out!"

I get compliments on everything I produce including photos, posters, memes, comics and other art projects that pop into my head. The more features you learn, the more you want to create. I have spent countless hours on this app and it has yet to fail meeting my needs. I just love it, end of story."
