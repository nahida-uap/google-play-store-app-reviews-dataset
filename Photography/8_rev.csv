or if long pressing buttons showed a toast saying what a button is/does but 
apart from that its class highly recommend it. Would be nice if we could

have won many awards from my projects using this app. Here are some things 
that you should work on this lovely app. (1) On the 'Effect' 'Colour 
Replace' option when I want to change a colour on my artwork, you have only 
provided hue colour chat from red, yellow, green, blue, red. This limits 
the design with colour swapping. I suggest if you can give an option on the 
colour chat, where we could play with all colours including white and black 
colours. (2) When I insert an image, then I set the option of 'text' yes it 
performs perfectly, but it limits on the option of ""Warp"" meaning I cant 
curve the texts made from inserted photo or image. Please fix this 
problems, then my world in design will be woooooooooow. (3) If you could 
also add an option of ""Effect""> Smooth Image. (4) On the ""Text/Image""> 
'Shape' there's a free crop square box with an option of round or sharp 
edges, then there's an option of 4, 8,12,16 nods. I suggest if you could 
add the nods to: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,24,32 for there are some artworks that 
require more nods to do effective cropping. Another issue is when typing a 
sentence to insert on the artwork, its damn impossible, the app cuts the 
sentence into two or three paragraphs, hence making it difficult to write a 
full sentence on artworks. If there were more than 5 stars, I would have 
given 10/10. Please fix these few issues, then all shall be wonderful, 
please do ASAP. Thanks Dev. Team, kindly work on these please, I've really 
been eagerly waiting for the next update with my suggested improvements on 
the app. Mostly I don't get to see any of my queries adapted on the new 
updates. Please kindly consider my suggestions. Thanks, am a true mad mad 
lover of Photo Editor"

absolutely critical for serious image editing on any Android platform. This 
app has been at the pinnacle of excellence for years and is frequently 
updated; it is simply indispensable. Lots of functionality that's absent in 
similar apps. Gimmick-free technical editing power that Photoshop users and 
graphic designers will really appreciate. The ad-free version of this app 
is worth 5x what I paid for it."
5,"March 24, 2018", I've been using this same app for about 5 yrs. I love it because it's simple to use for a beginner but has advanced features for someone more experienced!.
4,"March 24, 2018", I had this on my old phone. Downloaded it to my new one and some of my favourite fonts are missing :-( the fonts / text styles need updating. But apart from that it's great
5,"April 10, 2018"," I just love it. Batch processing, use my own TTF fonts, overlays, clone,... All I need (is love)! And it is free, too. THANKS!"

PC editing of images from my phone is now almost never needed. The dev is very responsive to questions and often adds new, useful features. One issue: after editing and saving, if I tap the top left back arrow, instead of going up one level in the same directory of my last edit as I'd prefer, I end up at the 'home' screen to choose what I want to do; when using the app's internal ""file browser"", though, browsing works as expected. Is there a workaround or can this be fixed?"
