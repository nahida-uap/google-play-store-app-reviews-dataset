2018 Do Not want to be asked to rate your app after I complete every photo 
- fix this problem.! March 29 2018, Still no resolution to this problem.!!I 
have a huge concern with your change to two finger resizing of photos, this 
is a discriminatory feature & needs to be removed . Did you think about 
people with disabilities when you introduced this backward step.? There are 
people that don't have the ability to use two fingers. It Discriminates 
against the elderly as well , not all users can place two fingers on a 
screen. You NEED to revert immediately to resizing photos by the previous 
method of having the resizing options on the corners of the photo ie: 
increase & decrease on one corner & rotation on the other corner. Also 
given the size of smart phones it is extremely difficult to place 2 fingers 
on the display & adjust tiny photos down to the required size. This change 
was ill conceived & lacked any thought to its suitability to all members of 
the community. . I trust you will rectify this issue with your next update"
