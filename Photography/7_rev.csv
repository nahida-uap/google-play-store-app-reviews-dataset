4,"July 17, 2018"," Very good.. but wish all the editor functions were free. I just had paid 
the extras for my iPhone but now I changed to an Android and will need to 
pay again for the same app.. so......"
5,"July 9, 2018"," Love this! It's not only good for simple edits, but also if you feel like 
blowing up your sister's legs, you can do that too 😂👌"
1,"July 11, 2018"," Cannot remove shadows. Edit: gave the app another shot. It also doesn't 
seem to overlay other images. Trying to put two people together. Not 
happening with this app. I'll find a better one for that."
1,"July 9, 2018"," Really dislike the trial model they use. You edit a photo to find out that 
you can't save it with the free version, and they blackmail you into 
watching three back-to-back advertisements to save."
5,"July 9, 2018"," I only started using it a short while ago but I really like it so far. You 
can do a lot, and the quality is good. I definitely recommend it."
5,"July 8, 2018"," New update is very bad to compare to old one it is very dark and blur than 
phone camera"
5,"July 16, 2018"," Love this app! Cannot believe it's free! It does everything those pricey 
programs do and more."
5,"July 15, 2018"," Too bad you gotta pay for some of the filters. But most of the tools are 
practical and easy to use."
5,"July 5, 2018", I just wanna say. You all look beautiful just. The. Way. You. Are.
5,"July 9, 2018"," Fantastic, easy to use program. I edit hundreds of photos a week for 
pamphlets, and this program is my new favorite."
1,"July 8, 2018"," Disgusting, you changed the app to charge for filters that used to be free."
4,"July 10, 2018"," I love the filters but it would be GREAT if you could add an option to pick 
a specific folder more easily than just scrolling forever to find the pic 
you're looking for or at least alphabetical order, that would be good also."
5,"July 10, 2018"," I dont usually rate apps but this one deserves a two thumbs up 🖒👍 Very 
good quality and user friendly. Highly recommended. 😊"
5,"July 7, 2018"," Finally my search for a good quality camera app has been fulfilled... 
Wonderful app.all in one ..Do try it once"
5,"July 14, 2018"," Every time I use this app I love it a little more. I haven't used it to 
dramatically change a picture but the subtle changes are really just the 
best for a picture. You seriously need to get this app!!"
5,"July 5, 2018", Love this App! Easy to use. Doesn't have a bunch of useless features.
5,"July 11, 2018"," So simple to use. Has different things to modify your pic. They should add 
pic frames to make it complete"
5,"July 15, 2018"," Pretty good app besides having a few things you have to pay for, but most 
of it's free and very useful for pic editing."
5,"July 13, 2018"," I suggest you to add some more features like change color and more effects. 
I love this app very much. It is very attractive."
5,"July 6, 2018", Very good picture quality... And useful app
5,"July 6, 2018", Best app to pimp your picture to look superbly beautiful.

5,"July 13, 2018"," Love it. I use it to edit my headshots myself. People always ask of I get 
my selfies and pics professionally done because the app tools are so good."
4,"July 16, 2018"," please makes it free,i m an student so its hard to buy packs"

5,"July 6, 2018", Makes all pictures look awesome

5,"July 15, 2018"," Does what I need it to do. Has more features that I need so that's never a 
bad thing :)"

best pic editing apps I've used on a mobile phone. The only complaint I 
have and the reason I left one star off is because I noticed a glitch. Some 
of the features you have to either pay 99 cents or Share on your Facebook 
to have complete access. I've noticed if I don't use the app for a couple 
of weeks, it resets and I have to Share it all over again. This didn't 
happen before the updates. It is inconvenient but the app is still great so 
it's worth it to keep. I won't pay for those features, however, because I'm 
afraid the app will reset and I'd have to keep paying for the same feature 
I already paid for. All in all, really awesome app. I would recommend it."

1,"July 7, 2018"," Editing is the worst I've ever come across. Unless you only take photos of 
white skinned people. Any one with a darker skin tone is whitewashed 
through the editing process. Each photo I tried ended up with the skin tone 
being lightened by several shades."
2,"July 7, 2018"," Super neat app! Does everything I need. Only problem I have is if i edit a 
picture with this app and save it the picture quality is significantly 
diminished after. Good enough for social media though!"
2,"July 17, 2018"," Watch ad to use the Sculpt 3 times for FREE yet ad couldn't load,literally 
no ad at all. So annoying"
5,"July 7, 2018"," Excellent ap but I would like to be able to see the image Im selecting in 
large to make sure its the right one before it goes to the editor. I KEEP 
selecting the wrong one over and over. Still an excellent app"

not working proper. Display photo (while camera is on) is different then

5,"July 17, 2018"," So far so good. I like the fact that you can either edit everyone's face or 
one person. I don't like apps that default to one person on my particular 
side of the picture. This app allows you to smooth out everyone's texture 
and edit everyone at once or individually."
5,"July 7, 2018"," New Bokeh Feature is really Awesome but there is a problem that it's 
blurring sometime wrong so here should be manual bokeh also to erase ✌"

need. Satisfied every time""""."
