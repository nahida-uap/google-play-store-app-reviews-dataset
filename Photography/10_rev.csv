using 3 apps to modify 1 pic. i wish it had more features like erase (maybe

without having to lose all yourjjj progress...like i said i probably havent 
found it but if it is im fact missing hook me me up!"
4,"July 9, 2018"," I have one complaint. When I use the coloring tool, I had a very limited 
selection of colors. I'd like it if they had a whole color chart to choose 
from. Other than that the app is super helpful and easy"
5,"May 9, 2018"," This is a great photo editor. I have only one problem and that is I cannot 
delete photos and I can't figure out how to print at a smaller size like 4 
X 5 onto my color laser printer."
4,"July 14, 2018"," This app is wonderful especially the collages! But one problem is if I want 
to choose another photo for the collage it doesn't let me"
1,"June 13, 2018"," The developers destroyed this App when they updated it recently. The 
blemish tool was the only reason myself and many others used this App. You 
used to be able to drag to remove blemishes. Now you have to tap and no 
matter what you do it no longer works. A once great app but now rubbish!"
5,"May 20, 2018"," I love this app. It's so simple and just does exactly what I need it to do 
for drawing and writing on photos. Easy, accessible and attached to lots of 
social media. I love this so much."
5,"July 13, 2018"," Has a giant verity of different filters and editing tools at no cost, would 
100% recommend"
5,"June 8, 2018"," Best photo app out there, does anything and everything u need in one free 
app. Magnifies pixs, better than zoom apps"
5,"June 12, 2018"," Everything I need is on this app alone. This would be an app I would 
purchase. Take a little more gb then I'd expect though. Still I'll keep it 
installed."
5,"June 17, 2018"," I've used this app since it came out it's been my #1 app in the whole 
market, you guys are incredible, id love to see a few investments and if be 
willing to help pay for those, new fonts options and better color pallets 
and whatever you can come up with. 200 stars."

2,"May 28, 2018"," I wonder why this app needs a permition to take photos in order to let me 
edit photos I already have in my gallery. It does not make any sense, as I 
already gave the app access to my gallery."

on Samsung the buttons don't even work. The ads do however. Avoid the phone

As far as photo editing goes, photo editor is a wonderful tool and I don't have to have a PhD in photography or computer science to use it. There's a lot of choice on tools, I've yet to discover them all.

I used the splash feature for a few years now, and it was amazing. Even had a few magazines and websites ask me to do work for them. Now you can't zoom in very far, the coloring becomes pixilated and leaves uncolored spots, and the eraser either doesn't erase enough or erases too much. You had an app that stood out from the rest, but with the ""new features"" and ""new look,"" it looks and works like you copied almost every other photo editing app out there. I literally downloaded and went through 11 apps that look and work exactly the same as this one now. Bring back the old style before the update, and I would gladly use this app again, and recommend it to people."

2,"February 1, 2018", I liked this app before the update. Now the blur tool is hard to use. Before it had a brush which was easy to swipe over flaws in photos. Now it has a spot tool which is very clumsy. Too bad. I really liked it before. Now I'm looking for a better app...

I worked almost three houres outlining a Photoshop I made and i pushed apply and it showed and i added text to it it looked h allarious and then I pushed save and when I went to the gallery it was not outlined at ALL but the words where still there. ITS SO FRUSTERATING. But its ok otherwise. :("

1,"August 3, 2015","Same thing, different name. Exactly the same as 3 other editors I've tried... down to the same button interfaces and everything... I mean at least make it look slightly different if you're going to try and fool people..."

4,"July 21, 2015",One thing I'd like It's awesome and I can only really suggest one improvement which is to be able to put elements of another photo on top.  The only reason I thought of this was because I used it to design a comic book cover.

I am just very dissapointed that this is just like an app I already have."
3,"November 22, 2017"," The effects are pretty good, but the edited pictures are compressed & decreasing in size after save. The original was 1280px, but after editing the edited picture became 1026px. It's a letdown. You should give an option for image size."

5,"November 11, 2017"," Really good app. Used it before switching to Samsung. Produces desired output with practice. Also on my phone, when saving my completed edit, it produces smaller photo file in a folder called ""pictures"" that can be easily texted to older phones. I love this feature!"

4,"October 12, 2015",Brilliant I love this so much! Does almost everything I would like it to. It makes my photos look so much nicer & the fact that you can whiten teeth & hide blemishes is awesome. Maybe add a few more options as to make it better? Thanks for making this app!

I absolutely LOVE it, & I DEFINITELY recommend this app for anyone who loves editing & creating photos. One wish for this app though: if we had a gallery on there to see all our edited photos. I know you can see it on your gallery on your own device, but I would love to see the full turnout on the app. Except from that, it's amazingly awesome!"

5,"July 17, 2017", Keep pestering to rate everytime it is turn on even tho it is already rated 5 stars. Quite annoying.
5,"May 8, 2016","Easy to use, quick and lots of options! I had to switch to an old Motorola Razr M from my iPhone temporarily, and this app was so helpful. Crops easily, lots of color options, but doesn't look ""overly filtered"", you can even whiten teeth! I would have liked a few more frame options, but for a free photo editor, I am very pleased."

4,"January 29, 2016",AWESOME FOR A FREE APP I would give 5 stars if there was a clone feature to get rid of spots and lines and areas I don't like. Otherwise sure makes pics way better than the original pic. Am I asking too much?
5,"July 9, 2015",Everything in one App! I've tried so many photo editing apps and this is the 1st one that has all the features I need in one. It's very easy to use too!  It was the easiest 5 star rating I ever gave.

5,"June 22, 2015",Photo Editor This is the easiest and best photo editing app I have found.  You can do a lot with the pictures and they turn out great.  If you need to edit photos this is the app to download.  I have tried many and I truly like this one.  Don't change a thing on this app please.  It's great the way it is.
3,"May 18, 2015",Its ok It doesn't show what it looks like on the screen. And some things you have to buy.
4,"October 21, 2014",Excellent Cool nice app but rating 4 since it does all the modifcations in the end and in the process it sometimes ends abruptly or takes too long
4,"July 17, 2015",Great Stuff Editing pictures is a lot better with a Photo Editor great results however sometimes an error occurs but that is the only negative the rest well it is really good.

5,"April 10, 2015","Can't complain Great app, I don't know anything about the other bad comments, but it works for me and I love it."
3,"April 14, 2015",Text sucks Using the app on the iPad I can change the font on the text feature and here its non existent so if I go to add something to a picture that is edited on my iPad I can't make it match what I already did.
4,"September 17, 2014",Pretty good app App is pretty good for quick fixes. Easy to use. Lots of options to choose from. Tried other apps but quickly switched back to this one because it is the best free app I've come across so far that doesn't actually ruin the picture.

1,"February 21, 2016","Meh There's nothing bad about it, its just there's nothing good about it. Its a weak after effect software that allows no proper editing. Maybe if its updated I'll reinstall."
3,"May 2, 2015",Where are the color stickers? A facebook friend posted some pics with cute colorful stickers from this app and I wanted it too. I installed it and only see some black and white stickers. What's up? Also a suggestion...make a way to change width of frames.
