1,"April 17, 2018"," The available effects are nothing special, and thisis one of a number of 
apps that plays loud audio/visual ads that show no respect for your data 
connection or your general surroundings. This kind of thing is intrusive 
and unwarranted."
3,"June 10, 2018"," It's good when it works. Kind of underwhelming but fine. The problem is the 
message that keeps popping up half the time you try to use one of the 
filters saying there are too many users and to try again."
5,"April 18, 2018"," It's a neat app. It does what it says and that's all I can ask for. As far 
as the ads, there are way worse apps that have ads pop up every other 
second. This isn't that bad and it IS a free app."
