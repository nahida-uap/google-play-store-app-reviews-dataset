the call can ring as well when i lock my phone. So far there is no ringing 
sound if i lock my phone only when my phone is unlock then they will make 
ringing sound. And two, if I didn't answer or reject the call the phone 
always keep ringing, better if you can make it more realistic and turn off 
the call automatically after a few moment if I didnt accept or reject the 
call. Overall very good app. Thanks."
