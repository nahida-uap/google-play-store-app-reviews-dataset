1,"February 3, 2018", Want to use this app for free? Just watch a video. You can earn  2 seconds of talk time if you watch a 30 second video. Seriously so your saying that your time is more valuable than mine? I'm not getting equal value. That's whack
5,"April 25, 2018"," Great app. I use this to dial out from my company inbound number and works 
a treat. Could do with a monthly subscription option to bring cost down,

that great app."

I will uninstall of course I would suggest any users of this app recheck their time and the minutes

This is easily the best company for Caller ID Spoofing and for Customer Service, there simply is no equal. If you want the best, look no further. The prices are unbeatable."
