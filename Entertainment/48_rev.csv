I can't always predict when I want a fake phone call, but it would be easy to covertly tap an icon on the home screen when I do need one. I would give four stars, rather than two, if that feature were available."

4,"June 1, 2011", All you need to do is slow down the voices... they speak so fast and never pause to let you talk and then it look fake.

4,"August 27, 2010"," Just tested it and let me tell you, IT WILL HELP in the future. The problem is that the call screen looks a little fake so it could get suspicious."
